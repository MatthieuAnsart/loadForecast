sequence variables</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Groups of interval variables may be constrained
to have relative positions of the start and end points of the interval
variables.</p>
<p class="p">An interval sequence variable alone does not enforce any
constraint on the relative position of the end points of the interval
variables. For instance, an interval variable <em class="ph i">a</em> could
be sequenced before an interval variable <em class="ph i">b</em> in a sequence <em class="ph i">p</em> without any impact on the relative position between
the start/end points of <em class="ph i">a</em> and <em class="ph i">b</em> (<em class="ph i">a</em> could still be fixed to start after the end of <em class="ph i">b</em>). Different semantics can be used to define how a sequence
constrains the positions of intervals. </p>
<p class="p">There are four sequencing constraints available on sequence
variables. The first in sequence constraint on an interval variable
and an interval sequence variable states that if the interval variable
is present, then it will be the first interval of the sequence. The
last in sequence constraint on an interval variable and an interval
sequence variable states that if an interval variable is present,
it will be the last interval of the sequence. The before constraint
on an interval sequence variable and two interval variable states
that if both interval variables are present, then the first interval
variable will appear in the sequence before the other interval. The
previous constraint on an interval sequence variable and two interval
variable states that if both interval variables are present then the
first interval variable will be just before the other in the sequence,
that is, it will appear before the second and no other interval will
be sequenced between the two intervals. </p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">C++ API</strong> of CP Optimizer, the functions <samp class="ph codeph">IloFirst</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">IloLast</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">IloBefore</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloPrev</samp> represent
the sequencing constraints.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">Java™ API</strong> of
CP Optimizer, the methods <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.first</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.last</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.before</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.prev</samp> represent the sequencing constraints.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">C# API</strong> of CP Optimizer, the methods <samp class="ph codeph">CP.First</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CP.Last</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CP.Before</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">CP.Prev</samp> represent
the sequencing constraints.</p>
<p class="p">The no overlap constraint on an interval sequence variable <em class="ph i">p</em> states that the sequence defines a chain of non-overlapping
intervals, any interval in the chain being constrained to end before
the start of the next interval in the chain. This constraint is typically
useful for modeling disjunctive resources.  </p>
<p class="p">A transition distance matrix can be specified, which defines
the minimal distance that must separate two consecutive intervals
in the sequence.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">C++ API</strong> of CP Optimizer, the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloNoOverlap</samp> represents a no overlap constraint.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">Java API</strong> of
CP Optimizer, the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.noOverlap</samp> returns
a no overlap constraint.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">C# API</strong> of CP Optimizer, the method <samp class="ph codeph">CP.NoOverlap</samp> returns a no overlap constraint.</p>
