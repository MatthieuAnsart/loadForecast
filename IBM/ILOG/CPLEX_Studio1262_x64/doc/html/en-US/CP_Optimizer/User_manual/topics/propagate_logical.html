<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Domain reduction of decision variables incident
on logical constraints are propagated using the truth values of the
subconstraints.</p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer can process logical constraints. Logical
constraints are stated over arithmetic constraints and also over some
specialized constraints. </p>
<p class="p">The connectors for creating logical constraints are described
in detail in <a class="xref" href="constraints_logical.html" title="Logical constraints make it possible to model complicated logical relations.">Logical constraints</a>.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> negation (<samp class="ph codeph">!</samp>), </p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">conjunction (<samp class="ph codeph">&amp;&amp;</samp>), </p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">disjunction (<samp class="ph codeph">||</samp>), </p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">implication (<samp class="ph codeph">IloIfThen</samp>),</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">equivalence (<samp class="ph codeph">==</samp>)
and </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">exclusive or (<samp class="ph codeph">!=</samp>). </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The semantics of these connectors are the usual logical
semantics. The arguments of these connectors are constraints that,
in turn, possibly could be logical constraints. For instance, consider
two tasks whose durations are represented by the integer values <em class="ph i">dx</em> and <em class="ph i">dy</em> and whose starting dates are
represented by the decision variables <em class="ph i">x</em> and <em class="ph i">y</em>.
To model the constraint that the two tasks do not overlap, you can
state the disjunction: </p>
<p class="p">  <em class="ph i">(x &gt;= y + dy) || (y &gt;= x + dx)</em></p>
<p class="p">To impose this constraint only when another condition
is true (for example when <em class="ph i">z == 3</em>), you can write the
logical constraint (shown here using the C++ API):  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloIfThen(env, z == 3, (x &gt;= y + dy) || (y &gt;= x + dx))
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To understand the domain reduction achieved by these constraints,
it is important to observe that a constraint has a truth value. Depending
on the domains of the variables, the truth value of a constraint is
true when the constraint is definitely satisfied. The truth value
is false when the constraint is definitely violated. Otherwise, both
values are possible. </p>
<p class="p">Consider, for instance, the constraint <em class="ph i">z ==
3</em>. It has a truth value of false when the domain of <em class="ph i">z</em> is
[0..2], that is, when it does not contain 3. It has a truth value
of true when <em class="ph i">z</em> is fixed to 3. The truth value of this
constraint is not yet determined when the domain of <em class="ph i">z</em> contains
the value 3 and at least one other value. The truth value is undetermined
if the domain of <em class="ph i">z</em> is [2..3]; it is not yet known
if the constraint <em class="ph i">z == 3</em> will be satisfied (<em class="ph i">z
= 3</em>) or violated (<em class="ph i">z = 2</em>). </p>
<p class="p">In practice, each constraint appearing in a logical expression
is associated with a Boolean decision variable whose value is the
truth value of the constraint. These Boolean variables are mentioned
in the search log as additional variables. </p>
<p class="p">Here is an example of a logical model using the C++ API:
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloIntVar x(env, 0, 5);
    IloIntVar y(env, 7, 20);
    IloIntVar z(env, -10, 20);
    IloModel model(env);
    model.add(x &gt;= y || z &lt; 7);
    model.add(IloIfThen(env, z != 10, y == 10));
    IloCP cp(model);
	 if (cp.propagate()) {
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domains reduced: " &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domain of x = " &lt;&lt; cp.domain(x) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domain of y = " &lt;&lt; cp.domain(y) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domain of z = " &lt;&lt; cp.domain(z) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }else{
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Model has no solution." &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
</code></pre>
<p class="p">In the first disjunction, the constraint <em class="ph i">x &gt;=
y</em> is obviously violated. To satisfy this disjunction, the constraint <em class="ph i">z &lt; 7</em> is imposed. This forces the maximum of the domain
of <em class="ph i">z</em> to be 6. The domain reduction of the implication
(<samp class="ph codeph">IloIfThen</samp>) constraint is invoked since
the domain of <em class="ph i">z</em> has changed. The left member of the
implication (<em class="ph i">z != 10</em>) is now satisfied and the constraint
imposes the constraint <em class="ph i">y == 10</em> which reduces the domain
of <em class="ph i">y</em>. No more domain reduction can be done at this
point and this code produces the output:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> Domains reduced:
 Domain of y = [10]
 Domain of z = [-10..6]
</code></pre>
<p class="p">This manner of reducing domains by imposing constraints
is very efficient, but it has some limitations. It reacts only to
violation or satisfaction of constraints. For instance, the domain
reduction of the constraint </p>
<p class="p">   <em class="ph i">(x == 2) || (x == 3)</em> </p>
<p class="p">will not reduce the domain of <em class="ph i">x</em> to [2..3].
It waits for one of the constraints to be violated before imposing
the other one. </p>
<p class="p">Since any arithmetic or logical constraint can have a
truth value, these constraints can appear where any other expression
can appear. In particular, such a constraint can be combined in an
arithmetic expression. An expression such as</p>
<p class="p">   <em class="ph i">1 + (x &lt; 7)</em></p>
<p class="p">is a valid expression and can be handled by CP Optimizer.
Constraints can be created over these expressions. For instance, recall
the disjunction</p>
<p class="p">   <em class="ph i">(x &gt;= y + dy) || (y &gt;= x + dx)</em></p>
<p class="p">It can be expressed by the constraint</p>
<p class="p">   <em class="ph i">(x &gt;= y + dy) + (y &gt;= x + dx) &gt;=
1</em></p>
<p class="p">Since only one of the disjunction members can be true,
it can also be stated as</p>
<p class="p">   <em class="ph i">(x &gt;= y + dy) + (y &gt;= x + dx) ==
1</em></p>
<p class="p">Similarly, the implication (here in the C++ API)</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph"> IloIfThen(env, z == 3, (x &gt;= y +
dy) || (y &gt;= x + dx))</samp></p>
<p class="p">can be expressed by </p>
<p class="p">   <em class="ph i">(z == 3) &lt;= ((x &gt;= y + dy) || (y &gt;=
x + dx))</em></p>
<p class="p">or by</p>
<p class="p">   <em class="ph i">(z == 3) &lt;= (x &gt;= y + dy) + (y &gt;=
x + dx)</em></p>
<p class="p">A typical application of such constraints are cardinality
constraints. When among a set of constraints at least two of them
must be true, one can state a constraint like</p>
<p class="p">   <em class="ph i">(x &gt;= y[0]) + (x &gt;= y[1]) + (x &gt;=
y[2]) + (x &gt;= y[3]) + (x &gt;= y[4]) &gt;= 2</em></p>
<p class="p">The statement of this constraint with only logical connectors
is possible but would need a large number of disjunctions.</p>
