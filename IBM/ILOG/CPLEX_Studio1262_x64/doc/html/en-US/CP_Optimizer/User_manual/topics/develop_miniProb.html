<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A representative miniproblem I useful for validation
and testing.</p>
<p class="p">Before you actually embark on the total application with
a final model, it's a good idea to experiment with small-scale models.
In that way, you'll acquire useful knowledge about the problem, and
you'll get this information early enough in development to be useful
later.</p>
<p class="p">In the model-prototype, the first decision to make is
how to identify a miniproblem from the overall problem. The miniproblem
provides the basis for a first-cut model of the whole problem. In
practice, it's important to get a first-draft model as early as possible.
That model serves two purposes: as a validation field for the specifications
and as an experimental domain for the feasibility of the project. </p>
<p class="p">It's thus critical to choose a <strong class="ph b">representative</strong> miniproblem
along the same lines as the choice of representative data discussed
in <a class="xref" href="develop_prepData.html" title="Preparing data for use in a CP Optimizer application involves ensuring that you have realistic, representative data and that the format is specified.">Preparing data</a>. If the miniproblem
that you identify is too simple, it won't show you how the application
will perform. If it's too complicated, it will demand too much work
and very possibly wasted effort if the model reveals a flaw in the
design. In other words, the choice of a miniproblem has serious consequences.
Your general experience and your knowledge of similar applications
will greatly facilitate your choice. One fallback choice (sometimes
the only choice) is to use a small-scale instance of the entire problem.</p>
<p class="p">This small-scale instance of the entire problem can help
you identify any difficult subproblems. After you identify a difficult
subproblem, you can focus on <strong class="ph b">resolution</strong> of
this subproblem and on <strong class="ph b">communication</strong> between
this subproblem and the rest of the problem. In this context, communication
between a subproblem and the rest of a greater problem can be expressed
through constraints between the variables in the subproblem and variables
in the rest of the problem as a whole.</p>
