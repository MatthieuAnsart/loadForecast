<h1 class="title topictitle1">Modeling stochastic scheduling problems on disjunctive resources</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Stochastic programming problems on disjunctive resources
can be modeled using same sequence constraints.</p>
<p class="p">Scheduling problems often involve some uncertainty in the data
and require computing a schedule that is, in a certain sense, robust
with respect to these uncertainties. Data can be uncertain for several
potential reasons such as activities taking more or less time than
originally estimated, resource availability that is subject to variability
(machine breakdowns, manpower absenteeism) or different unexpected
delays (materials arriving later than planned, weather conditions),
etc.</p>
<div class="p"> When facing a scheduling problem with uncertainties two important
questions should be answered first: <ol class="ol"><li class="li">Can I solve the deterministic version of the problem? Modeling
and solving a stochastic scheduling problem is more complex than modeling
and solving the deterministic variant of the problem where all uncertainties
have been ruled out. Being capable of efficiently solving the deterministic
version of the problem is always a <em class="ph i">prerequisite</em>.</li>
<li class="li">What is a solution to the robust scheduling problem? This question
is often harder than it seems. The traditional solution to a scheduling
problem, in the form of fixed start and end dates for activities is
in general too rigid and too brittle to be considered as robust. One
generally looks for a more flexible solution that implicitly represents
a <em class="ph i">set</em> of fully fixed schedules. The decision of which fixed
schedule to use, that is, the selection of actual start and end dates
for activities, is usually performed at schedule execution time. Stated
otherwise, a solution to a robust scheduling problem is in general
a particular <em class="ph i">execution policy</em> computed off-line that will be
used for on-line execution.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p class="p">When the scheduling problem is dominated by disjunctive resources,
like machines, tools or workers that can only perform one activity
at a time, a natural representation of a flexible schedule is the
sequence of activities on the resource. In this context, finding a
robust schedule boils down to finding a robust allocation and sequencing
of activities on resources.  </p>
<p class="p">The objective function of stochastic scheduling problems is often
related with the expectation of a certain performance criterion. Typical
examples include minimizing the expected project makespan or project
cost or maximizing the probability that a given level of service can
be satisfied. </p>
<p class="p">Most of the existing approaches for stochastic scheduling implement
a scenario-based framework, in which the uncertainty is modeled through
the use of a number of n scenarios. Each scenario is a deterministic
sub-problem that represents a particular realization of the uncertainties.
In practical applications, these scenarios may be given by a selection
of representative past execution of the system or they may be computed
by sampling the probability distributions of the random variables
related with uncertainties. </p>
<p class="p">A global model is built by aggregating these n scenarios. Some
constraints are added to ensure that the decisions taken off-line
in order to build a robust schedule (for instance allocation and sequencing
decisions) are consistent across all scenarios. The global objective
function is a combination of the individual objective function of
each scenario. </p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer provides a specific constraint <samp class="ph codeph">sameSequence</samp> to
state that two sequence variables should be ordered in the same way.
This constraint is particularly useful in stochastic scheduling problems
involving the creation of robust sequences on disjunctive resources.
It will be used to state that, for a given disjunctive resource, the
same sequencing of activities should be used across all n scenarios.
This is illustrated in Sample 1. </p>
<div class="p"><strong class="ph b">SAMPLE 1:</strong> Scenario-based model for a single disjunctive
resource<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloEnv env;
  IloModel model(env);
  IloInt n = ...; // Number of scenarios
  IloInt m = ...; // Number of activities on the machine
  IloIntArray2 dur = ...; // dur[i][j]: duration of activity j in scenario i
  
  IloIntervalVarArray2 act(env, n);        // act[i][j]: activity j in scenario i
  IloIntervalSequenceVarArray seq(env, n); // seq[i]: sequence of activities for scenario i
  for (IloInt i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
     // Scenario i
     act[i] = IloIntervalVarArray(env, m);
     for (IloInt j=0; j&lt;m; ++j) {
       act[i][j] = IloIntervalVar(env, dur[i][j]);
     }
     seq[i] = IloIntervalSequenceVar(env, act[i]);
     model.add(IloNoOverlap(env, seq[i]));
     if (0&lt;i) {
       // Same sequence across all scenarios
       model.add(IloSameSequence(env, seq[0], seq[i]));
     }
   }

<p class="p">A complete example of stochastic scheduling problem is available
in the delivered example  <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/cpoptimizer/examples/src/cpp/sched_stochastic_jobshop.cpp</samp>.
This problem is a stochastic version of the classical job-shop scheduling
problem where the duration of activities is uncertain and the objective
is to minimize the expected makespan. </p>
