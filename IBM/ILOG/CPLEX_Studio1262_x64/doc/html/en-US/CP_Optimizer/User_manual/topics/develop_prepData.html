<h1 class="title topictitle1">Preparing data</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Preparing data for use in a CP Optimizer application
involves ensuring that you have realistic, representative data and
that the format is specified.</p>
<p class="p">Start with clean, <strong class="ph b">realistic
data</strong>. If you don't have access to real data, you
should consider fabricating realistic data for this purpose.</p>
<p class="p">For example, imagine that you are developing a rostering
application for nurses in a hospital, where the roster covers six
months for 30 nurses with different levels of skill; six nurses are
highly qualified, 20 have standard qualifications, four are beginners.
The data set does not need to represent the nurses individually in
detail, but it needs to satisfy the number of nurses per day for each
service and the level of qualification of the nurses. Realistic data
for this rostering application must involve the same <strong class="ph b">proportion</strong> of qualified nurses, the
same <strong class="ph b">type</strong> of service
requests and so on.</p>
<p class="p">Realistic data must also be <strong class="ph b">representative</strong> even
when you are testing a reduced data set on a smaller version of the
problem. This principle means that some data in a smaller version
of a problem can simply be reduced, but other data must be reduced
only in ways that respect the proportions of the original problem
because changing the proportions among those data would effectively
change the problem to solve. To understand this difference between
data that can be reduced arbitrarily and representative data that
must respect proportions when it is reduced, consider the nurse rostering
example again. One way to reduce the size of the problem is simply
to consider a shorter period of time, for example, one month instead
of six months. In other words, from a constraint programming point
of view, the period of time can be reduced almost arbitrarily. In
contrast, if you reduce the number of nurses in your test data in
order to work with a smaller problem, your test data must still respect
the <strong class="ph b">proportions</strong> among
their levels of skill. For example, if you decide to test your application
on half the number of nurses (15 instead of 30), then a <strong class="ph b">representative data set</strong> must still include
three highly qualified, ten with standard qualifications and two beginners
in order to respect the proportions of the original problem.</p>
<p class="p">The solution of a combinatoric problem is quite sensitive
to variations in data, so you need to run, test and optimize an CP
Optimizer application with respect to <strong class="ph b">multiple
sets of data</strong> to have a reliable effect. In fact,
the robustness of your application will depend heavily on tests run
over several sets of data. This point about using multiple sets of
data to test your program is so important that if the client for your
application cannot supply multiple sets of real data, then you should
consider generating multiple sets of realistic data, for example,
by random variation.</p>
<p class="p">Early in development, you should also settle the <strong class="ph b">format of data</strong>. If, for example, it
is straightforward and quick to sort an array by posing a few constraints,
it will be even quicker to use a conventional sorting technique instead.
This guideline can be generalized: most ordinary preprocessing of
data (unrelated to constraint programming) can be handled more efficiently
in your chosen programming language rather than in CP Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">Use multiple sets of clean, valid, realistic data to
validate the model that you design. After you have validated it, your
first model itself will play the role of a reference. It will enable
you to test new solutions that you get from the implementations you
develop.</p>
<p class="p">Later, multiple sets of data may also help you tune performance,
as variations between data sets can highlight different aspects of
your application that may allow improvement.</p>
