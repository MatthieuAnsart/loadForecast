<h1 class="title topictitle1">Consider symmetry</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Considering whether removing symmetry helps in the search
for a solution is important in tuning the performance.</p>
<p class="p">Very often, real-world problems have symmetries. Consequently,
a direct model of the real-world problem will also have symmetries.
Examples of such symmetries are a fleet of identical trucks, a set
of identical containers, engineers with identical skills and so on.</p>
<p class="p">Eliminating symmetries in your models by adding constraints
can be beneficial, especially if the aim is to prove the optimality
or non-existence of a solution. For example, given a fleet of identical
trucks or containers, it is conventional to impose an arbitrary order
among them simply by numbering them. In that way, they are no longer
technically identical, and symmetries arising from their original
interchangeability are thus eliminated. </p>
<p class="p">However, eliminating symmetries does not always accelerate
the speed at which good solutions are found with CP Optimizer. There
are problems in which eliminating symmetry can force the search to
look in a less productive area of the solution space than it might
have pursued had all the possible paths remained available. </p>
<p class="p">In other words, while it may be a good idea to eliminate
symmetry in some problems, it is also necessary to check whether symmetry
serves a useful purpose in others. Consequently, you may need to experiment,
to test whether eliminating symmetry is a good idea in your model.
The best way to do so is to group all symmetry constraints in one
easily identifiable place in your model so that each one can be activated
or deactivated as you carry out these experiments.</p>
