<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Using expertise from the problem domain may help you
tune the search.</p>
<p class="p">At some point in developing your application with CP
Optimizer, you'll need to think about the criteria for choosing variables
and values. These choices are so specific to the problem under consideration,
sometimes even specific to the end-user, that there are no "canned"
rules ready to use "off-the-shelf." You really must exploit professional
expertise from the problem domain.</p>
<p class="p">Professional knowledge about the problem itself proves
useful in tuning the search. In real-world problems (unlike purely
theoretical problems) the hardest parts are actually often confined
to one sole part of the model. In consequence, you have to start searching
for a partial solution in that region in order to minimize the exponential
factor.</p>
<p class="p">For example, when you're building a schedule, you have
to assign the most difficult or the most critical items first. The
easier parts fall into place around them. A domain expert helps you
identify the difficult or critical items of a scheduling application.</p>
<p class="p">This kind of solution clearly shows that the procedure
for solving a problem depends very much on the instance of the problem
under consideration, not strictly on its formal statement. </p>
