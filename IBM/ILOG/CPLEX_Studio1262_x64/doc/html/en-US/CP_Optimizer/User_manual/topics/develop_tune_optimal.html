important in tuning the performance.</p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer treats optimization problems by enforcing
the idea that the current solution must be better than the preceding
solution at each iteration in terms of a cost. Parameters, such as <samp class="ph codeph">OptimalityTolerance</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">RelativeOptimalityTolerance</samp>,
enable you to control how much better the following solution must
be.</p>
<p class="p">The essential factor is in the propagation of the cost
variable. At every moment, its boundaries must be the best evaluation
possible of the cost of the solution partially examined.</p>
<p class="p">“Optimality at all costs” is frequently
unrealistic or even impossible. The behavior that you, as a developer,
want from an optimization application is to achieve significantly
better solutions very fast. With such an aim, it may be relevant to
impose a rule such as, “the next solution must be 10% better
than the current one.” Or, for example, it may be a good idea
to eliminate once and for all the solutions close to the one already
obtained by removing the values near the value belonging to the most
recent solution. </p>
