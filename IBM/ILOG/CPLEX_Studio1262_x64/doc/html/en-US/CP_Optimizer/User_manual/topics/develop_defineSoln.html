<h1 class="title topictitle1">Defining a solution</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A solution satisfies the constraints of the problem. </p>
<p class="p">In CP Optimizer, a solution can never violate a constraint.
By definition, a solution satisfies the constraints of the problem,
and any problem in which a constraint is violated has no solution
in constraint programming terms. </p>
<p class="p">In contrast, when a client specifies the requirements
of a problem, the client may have loose or vague ideas about ways
in which an acceptable solution might violate a constraint<em class="ph i"> just a little bit</em>; or a solution
might ignore certain restrictions <em class="ph i">sometimes</em>;
or a solution could overlook a requirement <em class="ph i">if necessary</em>. </p>
<p class="p">To cope with this difference between how constraint programming
construes a solution and what your client expects as a solution, you
must first understand what the client regards as a solution. One approach
to this task is to ask your client for a sample solution.</p>
<p class="p">If the known solution fails in your application, then
you know that your model does not correspond to the client’s
idea of an acceptable solution. Your next task, then, is to agree
with the client about what really constitutes a solution to the problem.
A first step toward this agreement is to identify which constraints
can never be violated in the client’s mind. For example, security
regulations might be such: no solution acceptable to the client should
violate a security regulation. In such a problem, security regulations
will consequently be expressed as constraints.</p>
