<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Specialized constraints make it possible to express complicated
relationships between variables.</p>
<p class="p">One of the most powerful features of CP Optimizer is
its provision for different kinds of constraints. </p>
<p class="p">You have already seen arithmetic constraints that enable
you to combine decision variables with the usual arithmetic operators
(such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to create
linear and nonlinear expressions. In addition, CP Optimizer supports
constraints on expressions that are not arithmetic: absolute value,
minimum, maximum.</p>
<p class="p">Specialized constraints make it possible to express complicated
relations between variables, for example, relations that would require
an exponential number of arithmetic constraints or relations that
could not be expressed at all in arithmetic terms. Specialized constraints
enter into such considerations as counting values, maintaining load
weights and other critical activities.</p>
<p class="p">Specialized constraints prove useful in a great many
fields, in such mathematical puzzles as magic sequences and magic
squares, but also in very practical real-world problems of allocation
and scheduling. For example, the predefined “all different”
constraint states that the value assigned to each variable in an array
must be different from the values assigned to every other variable
in that array. </p>
<p class="p">Also, the single specialized all different constraint
on <em class="ph i">n</em> variables is
logically equivalent to <em class="ph i">(n-1)n/2</em> instances
of the “not equal” constraint (<samp class="ph codeph">!=</samp>),
but in terms of performance, that single constraint is much more efficient.
In short, a specialized constraint such as is highly useful, both
in terms of ease of expression and computational performance.</p>
<p class="p">For detailed information on the specialized constraints
that are available in CP Optimizer, refer to the section <a class="xref" href="constraints_specialized.html" title="Specialized constraints on integer decision variables are designed and implemented to reduce domains of variables efficiently during a search.">Specialized constraints on integer decision variables</a> and <a class="xref" href="constraints_interval.html" title="CP Optimizer provides specialized expressions and constraints on interval decision variables.">Constraints and expressions on interval decision variables</a> in <a class="xref" href="constraints.html" title="Constraints and expressions are building blocks that can be used to create models in CP Optimizer applications.">Constraints and expressions in CP Optimizer</a>.</p>
