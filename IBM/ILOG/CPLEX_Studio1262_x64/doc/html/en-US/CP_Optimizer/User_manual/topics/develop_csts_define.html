<h1 class="title topictitle1">Define all constraints</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A model must contain all of the constraints.</p>
<p class="p">Technically satisfying the constraints in a specification
may not always meet the client’s expectation. </p>
<p class="p">For example, in the design of a telecommunication network,
the problem description might demand that every pair of nodes in the
network must have at least two paths between those nodes for robustness
and reliability.</p>
<p class="p">To meet that demand, one might design a model, taking
into account that constraint on every pair of nodes. In a first-cut
of that model, CP Optimizer could find a solution that is quite logical:
the solution consists of a huge loop, passing through every node.
Since a such a loop can be traversed in both directions, this first-cut
solution technically contains two paths to between every pair of nodes,
though the paths between some pairs may be rather long. When the solution
is shown to the client, however, the designer learns, alas, that solution
is not acceptable in practice, so the designer goes back to the phase
of describing the problem again and adds constraints on the length
of paths between pairs of nodes. In consequence of this change in
the problem <em class="ph i">description</em>,
the <em class="ph i">model</em> and the <em class="ph i">implementation</em> must change as well.<em class="ph i"> </em></p>
<p class="p">A better problem description in the first place (one
that included all the constraints, especially those on the lengths
of paths between pairs of nodes) might have avoided this repetition.
Certainly a sound initial problem description is the surest safeguard
against the infamous encroachments of an incremental specification. </p>
