<h1 class="title topictitle1">Constraint propagation during search</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Constraint propagation is combined with a constructive
search strategy is used by CP Optimizer in the search for solutions
to constraint programming problems. </p>
<p class="p">The CP Optimizer engine performs constraint propagation
during search. This constraint propagation differs from the initial
constraint propagation. The initial constraint propagation removes
all values from domains that will not take part in <em class="ph i">any</em> solution. Constraint propagation
during search removes all values from the <em class="ph i">current</em> domains
that violate the constraints. You can think of constraint propagation
during search in the following way. In order to “try”
a value for a variable, the optimizer creates “test”
or <em class="ph i">current</em> domains.
When constraint propagation removes values from domains during search,
values are only removed from these “test” domains. </p>
<p class="p">To continue the same example, suppose that, based on
the search strategy, the optimizer has assigned the value 10 to the
decision variable <em class="ph i">x</em>.
Working with the constraint <em class="ph i">x + y = 17</em>,
constraint propagation reduces the domain of <em class="ph i">y</em> to [7]. However, this combination
of values (<em class="ph i">x = 10</em>, <em class="ph i">y = 7</em>) violates the constraint <em class="ph i">x - y = 5</em>. The
optimizer removes the value <em class="ph i">y = 7</em> from
the current domain of <em class="ph i">y</em>.
At this point, the domain of <em class="ph i">y</em> is
empty, and the optimizer encounters a <em class="ph i">failure</em>.
The optimizer can then conclude that there is no possible solution
with the value of 10 assigned to <em class="ph i">x</em>.</p>
<p class="p">When the optimizer decides to try a different value for
the decision variable <em class="ph i">x,</em> the
domain of <em class="ph i">y </em>is at
first restored to the values [5 6 7]<samp class="ph codeph">.</samp> It
then reduces the domain of <em class="ph i">y</em> based
on the new value assigned to <em class="ph i">x</em>. </p>
<p class="p">This simple example demonstrates the basic concepts of
constructive search and constraint propagation. To summarize, solving
a problem consists of finding a value for each decision variable while
simultaneously satisfying the constraints. The CP Optimizer engine
uses two techniques to find a solution: constructive search with search
strategies and constraint propagation. Additionally, the optimizer
performs two types of constraint propagation: initial constraint propagation
and constraint propagation during search.</p>
<p class="p">The initial constraint propagation removes values from
domains that will not take part in any solution. After initial constraint
propagation, the search space is reduced. This remaining part of the
search space, where the CP Optimizer engine will use constructive
search with a search strategy to search for a solution, is called
the search tree. Constructive search is a way to “try”
a value for a variable to see if this will lead to a solution. The
optimizer performs constraint propagation during search. Constraint
propagation during search removes all values from the current or “test”
domains that violate the constraints. If the optimizer cannot find
a solution after a series of choices, these can be reversed and alternatives
can be tried. The CP Optimizer engine continues to search using the
constructive search and constraint propagation during search until
a solution is found. </p>
