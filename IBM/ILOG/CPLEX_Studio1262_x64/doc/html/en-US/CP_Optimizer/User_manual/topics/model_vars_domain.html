<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The set of possible values of a decision variable or
expression is known as its domain.</p>
<p class="p">An integer decision variable is typically created with
a lower bound and an upper bound. </p>
<p class="p">The initial <em class="ph i">domain</em> of
the variable contains precisely the values from the lower bound to
the upper bound, inclusive. It is important to declare the initial
domains to be as small as possible, in order to keep the search space
as small as possible. As the optimizer works to find a solution for
the problem, it will temporarily remove values from the domain of
each decision variable. The search algorithms are discussed in detail
in <a class="xref" href="search.html" title="CP Optimizer uses constructive search strategies to find a solution to a constraint programming problem.">Search in CP Optimizer</a>.</p>
<p class="p">During search, expressions have domains of possible values
like decision variables. Unlike variables, these domains are not stored
but instead calculated as needed from the basic elements of the expression.
 </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Declaring a domain </strong> </p>

<p class="p">Domains for integer decision variables are declared as
part of the model. In order for the search to perform efficiently,
it is important that the domains be as tight, or small, as possible. </p>
