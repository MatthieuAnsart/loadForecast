<h1 class="title topictitle1">All different constraint</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The all different constraint is a specialized
constraint which forces every decision variable in a given group to
assume a value different from the value of every other decision variable
in that group. </p>
<p class="p">An all different constraint forces every decision variable
in a given group to assume a value different from the value of every
other decision variable in that group. In other words, no two of those
decision variables will have the same integer value when this constraint
is satisfied.</p>
<p class="p">For example, if the decision variables <em class="ph i">x</em>, <em class="ph i">y</em> and <em class="ph i">z</em> share the domain of integers
from 1 through 10, inclusive, then an all different constraint applied
to <em class="ph i">x</em>, <em class="ph i">y</em> and <em class="ph i">z</em> could
return such solutions as 1, 2, 3 or 4, 6, 8 or 9, 5, 2. However, 1,1,
2 would not be a solution to an all different constraint over those
three variables.</p>
