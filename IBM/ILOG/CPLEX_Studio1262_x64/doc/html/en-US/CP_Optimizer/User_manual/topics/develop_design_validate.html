<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Validating the model with data and constraints helps
you to check the constraints.</p>
<p class="p">As mentioned in <a class="xref" href="develop_prepData.html" title="Preparing data for use in a CP Optimizer application involves ensuring that you have realistic, representative data and that the format is specified.">Preparing data</a>, you need
to validate your model with clean, realistic data. In fact, it is
a good idea to validate your model with multiple sets of data, as
combinatoric problems are notoriously sensitive to slight variations
in data. </p>
<p class="p">Validation is greatly simplified if a solution is already
available to you. With a known solution, you can check the way that
your constraints have been written so that you will be alerted to
any errors in interpretation or any bug in translation between the
specification and the implementation. You can also check the global
coherence of your initial constraints, their coherence as a set. That
is, when you have a known solution already, you can use it as a reference
point in testing and verification.</p>
