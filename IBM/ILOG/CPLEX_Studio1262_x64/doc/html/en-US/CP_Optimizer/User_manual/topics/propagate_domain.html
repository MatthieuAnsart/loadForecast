<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Constraint propagation reduces the domains of
decision variables.</p>
<p class="p">Each decision variable in an IBM® ILOG® Concert Technology model has
a <em class="ph i">domain</em> that is the set of its possible values. </p>
<p class="p">For instance, the domain of the decision variable   </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloIntVar x(env, -1, 2);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">is the set of values {-1, 0, 1, 2} , represented as [-1..2].
    </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p">In IBM ILOG Concert Technology and CP
Optimizer, square brackets denote the <em class="ph i">domain</em> of decision
variables. For example, [5 12] denotes a domain as a set consisting
of precisely two integers, 5 and 12. In contrast, [5..12] denotes
a domain as a range of integers, that is, the interval of integers
from 5 to 12, so it consists of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.  </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">A constraint is stated over one or more decision variables
and restricts the possible assignments of values to these variables.
The possible assignments are the solutions of the constraint. For
instance, the constraint <em class="ph i">x &lt;= y</em> allows the assignments <em class="ph i">x = 0</em>, <em class="ph i">y = 1</em> or <em class="ph i">x = 2</em>, <em class="ph i">y = 2</em> but not <em class="ph i">x = 3</em>, <em class="ph i">y =
2</em>.      </p>
<p class="p">A constraint can perform domain reduction on its decision
variables to eliminate from their domains values that do not belong
to a solution of the constraint. When the domain reduction algorithm
is such that it removes all the values that do not belong to a solution,
the process is called full domain reduction. Full domain reduction
sometimes can be very costly in terms of computation time, so, in
practice, the domain reduction performed by a constraint does not
necessarily eliminate all inconsistent values. </p>
<p class="p">As an example, consider the variables <em class="ph i">x</em> and <em class="ph i">y</em>, each of which has the initial domain [1..10] and the
constraint <em class="ph i">x + y &lt;= 5</em>. </p>
<p class="p">The domain of each variable is the set of integer values
from 1 to 10. A solution to the constraint x + y &lt;= 5 is the assignment
to x and y any combination of values from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. The
assignment <em class="ph i">x = 5</em> does not lead to a solution for this
constraint as there is no value in the domain of <em class="ph i">y</em> that
satisfies the constraint when <em class="ph i">x = 5</em>. A full domain
reduction for this constraint eliminates all values greater than 4
from the domains of <em class="ph i">x</em> and <em class="ph i">y</em>, and thus
the domains of <em class="ph i">x</em> and <em class="ph i">y</em> are reduced
to the interval [1..4].</p>
