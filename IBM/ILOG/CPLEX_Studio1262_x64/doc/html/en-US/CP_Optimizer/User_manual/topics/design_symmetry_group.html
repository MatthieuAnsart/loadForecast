<h1 class="title topictitle1">Group by type</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">One way to remove symmetries is to group by type.</p>
<p class="p">When two or more variables have identical characteristics,
it is pointless to differentiate them artificially. </p>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerdesign.1009997__migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerdesign.1009999"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Principle</h2><p class="p">Rather, it is preferable to design a model that takes
into account not simply the elementary entities but instead the types
into which the elementary entities can be meaningfully grouped. Each
such type, of course, quantitatively handles the elementary entities
that belong to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerdesign.1009997__migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerdesign.1010002"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example</h2><p class="p">For example, consider the problem of plugging electronic
cards into racks. Assume that there are five types of cards. Each
rack may contain only a finite number of cards according to some constraints.
The objective is to minimize the number of racks used. This problem
may be formulated in two different ways: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">first model: for each card, the problem
is to find the rack where it is to be plugged; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">second model: for each rack, the problem
is to find the number of cards of a given type plugged into it. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In the first model, there is one variable per card. Once
a solution has been found, any permutation of two cards of the same
type defines a “new” solution. The search space is consequently
large and contains many such symmetrical solutions that are not of
interest.</p>
<p class="p">In the second model, the number of cards of a given type
is manipulated, rather than the cards themselves. This model suppresses
the symmetries introduced by the previous one and thus reduces the
search space.</p>
