<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Determining the degree of precision that represents a
reasonable trade-off between numeric accuracy in the solution and
acceptable performance in your application is important.</p>
<p class="p">Clearly, the degree of precision (that is, the granularity
of the definition and solution) needs to be adapted to the aims of
the application. There is no point in counting seconds if your problem
works in terms of years. In short, choose an appropriate unit, both
for the problem representation and for the solution.</p>
<p class="p">High precision may mean slower performance. You may need
to experiment to determine the degree of precision that represents
a reasonable trade-off between numeric accuracy in the solution and
acceptable performance in your application.</p>
