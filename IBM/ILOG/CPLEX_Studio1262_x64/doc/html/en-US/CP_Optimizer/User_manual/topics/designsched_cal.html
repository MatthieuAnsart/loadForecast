<h1 class="title topictitle1">Modeling resource calendars</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Resource calendars can be modeled using a stepwise function
that describes the intensity of "work" over time.</p>
<p class="p">Many scheduling problems, especially in project scheduling,
involve calendars for resources. </p>
<p class="p">These calendars specify periods of time such that:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">the resource is not available and suspends
a task it is working on,</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the resource works with a limited efficiency
so that a task requiring this resource will take more time during
these periods,</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> the resource cannot start or finish
executing a task during such a period, </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">a task requiring the resource cannot
overlap such a period or</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">a task can overlap these periods but
the total overlap must be retrieved as an integer expression (typically
to be minimized as part of the cost).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In CP Optimizer, this notion of a resource calendar is
represented by a stepwise function that describes the intensity of
"work" over time. An interval variable can be associated with an integer
stepwise intensity function with possible values expressed as a percentage
in [0,100]. The intensity function represents an instantaneous ratio
between the size and the length of an interval variable. Cases (1)
and (2) can be represented by an intensity function. Case (1) is a
special case with the intensity function being equal to 0 on the time
periods the resource suspends the execution of tasks. Other constraints
can be modeled using the constraints <samp class="ph codeph">IloForbidStart</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloForbidEnd</samp> (for
case 3) and <samp class="ph codeph">IloForbidExtent</samp> (for case 4).
 </p>
<p class="p">The sample below defines an intensity function equal
to 100% except for the weekends (intervals <samp class="ph codeph">[5+7i,7+7i]</samp>)
for which the intensity is 0%, that is, the resource suspends its
tasks on weekends.  </p>
<p class="p">Task <samp class="ph codeph">task1</samp> will be suspended
during weekends.  </p>
<p class="p">Task <samp class="ph codeph">task2</samp> will be suspended
during weekends and cannot start during a weekend.  </p>
<p class="p">Task <samp class="ph codeph">task3</samp> will be suspended
during weekends and cannot start or end during a weekend.  </p>
<p class="p">Task <samp class="ph codeph">task4</samp> must be completely
executed during a week so that it cannot overlap a weekend.  </p>
<p class="p">Task <samp class="ph codeph">task5</samp> of length 7 days
can overlap weekends but the total duration of the task performed
during weekends (<samp class="ph codeph">ov5</samp>) is to be minimized.</p>
