<h1 class="title topictitle1">Propagation of arithmetic constraints</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Propagation of arithmetic constraints works to reduce the
bounds of the incident decision variables.</p>
<p class="p">In the C++ API, CP Optimizer can handle arithmetic expressions
created with the operators <samp class="ph codeph">+</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">-</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">*</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">/</samp>.
Arithmetic constraints are created with arithmetic expressions and
operators like <samp class="ph codeph">==</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;=</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">&gt;=</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">&gt;</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">For example, the constraint <em class="ph i">17*p*q + x/y &lt;= 100</em>, where <em class="ph i">p</em>, <em class="ph i">q</em>, <em class="ph i">x</em> and <em class="ph i">y</em> are
decision variables, can be handled by CP Optimizer. These operators
are discussed in more detail in the section <a class="xref" href="constraints_arithmetic.html" title="Arithmetic constraints and expressions may consist of linear and nonlinear arithmetic terms.">Arithmetic constraints and expressions</a>. The Java™ API and C# API equivalents of the operators
are listed there as well.</p>
<p class="p">Apart from a few cases that are described below, arithmetic constraints
do not achieve full domain reduction because there does not always
exist an efficient algorithm for full domain reduction. Thus, domain
reduction is mostly applied to bounds of decision variables and is
called bound reduction. Bound reduction is considered as a good trade-off
between the number of values removed and the efficiency of the domain
reduction algorithm.</p>
<p class="p">For example, consider the model:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloIntVar x(env, -7, 7);
    IloIntVar y(env, -7, 7);
    IloModel model(env);
    model.add(0.5*x + 3*y == 5);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The two solutions of this model are <em class="ph i">x = -2, y = 2 </em>and <em class="ph i">x
= 4, y = 1</em>. Full constraint propagation would give the domain
of <em class="ph i">x</em> as [-2 4] and the domain of <em class="ph i">y</em> as [1 2]. However,
CP Optimizer does not perform this domain reduction. The constraint
propagation engine does not create “holes” in the domain of <em class="ph i">x</em>.
The reduced domain of <em class="ph i">x</em> is [-2..4]. </p>
<p class="p">There are exceptions to this behavior. These are binary constraints
of the form <em class="ph i">y == a*x + b</em>, where <em class="ph i">y</em> and <em class="ph i">x</em> are variables
and <em class="ph i">a</em> and <em class="ph i">b</em> are numerical values. In this case, full
domain reduction is achieved.</p>
<p class="p"> For instance consider the constraint <em class="ph i">y == 2*x</em> over the
variables <em class="ph i">x</em> with domain [1..3] and <em class="ph i">y</em> with domain [0..10].
This constraint forces <em class="ph i">y</em> to be even. Full domain reduction
is performed and reduces the domain of <em class="ph i">y</em> to [2 4 6]. The main
reason for achieving full domain reduction in this case is that it
does not hurt the efficiency of constraint propagation, and it can
be effective to propagate holes in domains from a constraint to another
when there are linking constraints like <em class="ph i">x == y</em> in a model.</p>
<p class="p">Another case is that of linear inequalities such as <em class="ph i">x + 3y -
4z &lt;= 10</em>. Achieving bound reduction for these constraints is
sufficient to achieve full domain reduction. </p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer provides bound reduction for expressions such as absolute
value, minimum, maximum and piecewise linear functions. On these expressions,
achieving bound reduction is sufficient to maintain full domain reduction.</p>
<p class="p">In the C++ API, an absolute value expression is created with the
function <samp class="ph codeph">IloAbs</samp>. Consider the following code:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloIntVar x(env, -10, 20);
    IloIntVar y(env, -3, 4);
    IloModel model(env);
    model.add(y == IloAbs(x));
    IloCP cp(model);
    if (cp.propagate()){
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domains reduced: " &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domain of x = " &lt;&lt; cp.domain(x) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domain of y = " &lt;&lt; cp.domain(y) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }else{
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Model has no solution." &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Running this code, the domains of both <em class="ph i">x</em> and <em class="ph i">y</em> are
reduced. The domain of <em class="ph i">y</em> is reduced so that it is positive
and the domain of <em class="ph i">x</em> is reduced to take into account the maximum
value of <em class="ph i">y</em>:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> Domains reduced:
 Domain of x = [-4..4]
 Domain of y = [0..4]
</code></pre>
<p class="p">In the C++ API, minimum and maximum values expressions over a set
of variables are created with the <samp class="ph codeph">IloMin</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloMax</samp> expressions.
For example consider the model:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloIntVar x(env, 0, 10);
    IloIntVar y(env, 4, 6);
    IloIntVar u(env, 2, 10);
    IloModel model(env);
    model.add(u == IloMin(x, y));
    IloCP cp(model);
	 if ( cp.propagate() ) {
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domains reduced: " &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domain of x = " &lt;&lt; cp.domain(x) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domain of y = " &lt;&lt; cp.domain(y) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Domain of u = " &lt;&lt; cp.domain(u) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }else{
      cp.out() &lt;&lt; " Model has no solution." &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The value of <em class="ph i">u</em> cannot exceed the smallest upper bound of <em class="ph i">x</em> and <em class="ph i">y</em>,
that is 6. Moreover, <em class="ph i">x</em> nor <em class="ph i">y</em> cannot have a value smaller
than the lower bound of <em class="ph i">u</em>, which is 2. The domains of the variables
after running this code are:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> Domains reduced:
 Domain of x = [2..10]
 Domain of y = [4..6]
 Domain of u = [2..6]
