<h1 class="title topictitle1">Use dual representation</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Using dual representation to consider the problem for
a different view is a model design principle to consider.</p>
<p class="p">Object programming and straightforward object manipulation
in CP Optimizer often make it possible to design a direct and very
intuitive model of a problem. Nevertheless, it is important not to
get stuck in this apparent simplicity if that model gives rise to
a disproportionate amount of propagation or outright inefficiency.</p>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerdesign.1009951__migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerdesign.1009962"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Principle</h2><p class="p">Dual representation consists of looking at a problem
“from the other side,” so to speak. This technique assumes
that the designer knows enough about the problem to step back and
consider its essence and thus extract conceptual symmetries inherent
in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerdesign.1009951__migration.uss_usrcpoptimizerdesign.1009965"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example</h2><p class="p">Allocating resources offers a good example of this phenomenon.
Assume that <em class="ph i">C</em> consumers
must choose among <em class="ph i">R</em> resources;
to make it simple, consider the case where:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">all the resources are available to every
consumer; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">each consumer uses at most one resource; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">each resource may be used by at most
one consumer. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The apparent complexity of the problem depends on the
kind of model. In practice, there are two possible models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The consumers choose resources. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The resources choose consumers. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In the first case, if a constrained variable representing
the chosen resource is associated with each consumer, there are <em class="ph i">C</em> variables with a domain of size <em class="ph i">R+1</em>, where <em class="ph i">R</em> is the number of possible resources.
The apparent complexity of the problem in this model is thus <em class="ph i">(R+1)</em><sup class="ph sup">C</sup>. </p>
<p class="p">The second case is, of course, analogous to the first:
associate a constrained variable with each resource such that the
variable represents the chosen consumer, so there are <em class="ph i">R</em> variables with a domain of size <em class="ph i">C+1</em>, where <em class="ph i">C</em> is the number of possible consumers.
The apparent complexity of the problem in this model is thus <em class="ph i">(C+1)</em><sup class="ph sup">R</sup>.</p>
<p class="p">When the difference in apparent complexity is great,
it is important to consider the magnitude of <em class="ph i">C</em> and <em class="ph i">R</em> very
carefully.</p>
