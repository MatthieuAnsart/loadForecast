<h1 class="title topictitle1">Overview</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CP Optimizer uses constructive search strategies to find
a solution to a constraint programming problem.</p>
<p class="p">A methodical approach to developing an application using
CP Optimizer begins with a verbal description of the problem and moves
directly to the model or representation. Once the model is created,
you are ready to solve it using the optimizer. For most problems,
using the basic solve function is all that is needed for solving the
model. Nonetheless, CP Optimizer offers a variety of controls that
allow you to tailor the solution process for your specific needs. </p>
<p class="p">The CP Optimizer engine searches for an optimal solution
or, if the problem is a satisfiability one, a solution of a model.
A solution is an assignment of values to variables such that every
constraint in the model is satisfied. </p>
<p class="p">A naive way to find a solution would be to explicitly
study each possible combination of values for decision variables until
a solution is found. The CP Optimizer search implicitly generates
such combinations but in a very efficient manner using constraint
propagation. It produces an optimal solution for optimization problems
and at least one solution for satisfiability problems.</p>
<p class="p">The implicit generation of combinations uses <em class="ph i">constructive search strategies</em>. A
constructive strategy attempts to build a solution by choosing a non-fixed
decision variable and a value for that variable. The chosen variable
is then fixed to the chosen value, and constraint propagation is triggered.
This operation is called <em class="ph i">branching</em>,
and the fixing is also called a “branch”. Constraint
propagation reduces the domains of variables and, consequently, the
currently possible combinations. After propagation terminates, another
non-fixed variable, if one exists, is chosen, and the process repeats
until all decision variables are fixed. However, if a fixing fails
because it cannot lead to a solution, the constructive strategy <em class="ph i">backtracks</em> and chooses another value
for the variable.</p>
<p class="p">The CP Optimizer constructive search strategies are guided
towards optimal solutions in order to converge rapidly. The CP Optimizer
search uses a variety of guides and uses the most appropriate one
depending on the model structure and on constraint propagation. This
section explains the standard search algorithms used.</p>
