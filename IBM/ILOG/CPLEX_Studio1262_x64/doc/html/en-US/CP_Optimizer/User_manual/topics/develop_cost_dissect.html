<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">It is important to separate distinct types of costs so
that each aspect of the cost function can be appropriately studied
while the model is being built.</p>
<p class="p">It is important to have a clear definition of the cost
function (or objective) to optimize. Often this function will contain
diverse components or terms to optimize, each relating to a different
part of the business. </p>
<p class="p">Only part of this cost function may be a measure of monetary
profit or cost. Other parts may be related to subjective criteria
or perceived inconvenience to the business. For example, some parts
of the cost function may depend on work practices, labor conventions,
customary habits of employees. Parts of the cost function corresponding
to these optimizations can often change quite dramatically during
the course of a project.</p>
<p class="p">It is important to separate distinct types of costs so
that each aspect of the cost function can be appropriately studied
while the model is being built. Such a separation will also help you
represent the problem more accurately in your model. A good representation
of the cost function will also help you communicate effectively with
your client.</p>
