<h1 class="title topictitle1">Retrieving search information</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Information about the search can be retrieved
from the search log as well as by using functions provided by CP Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">There are several ways to obtain information regarding
the search. One way is by examining the search log as discussed in
the section <a class="xref" href="search_log.html" title="During search, information regarding the progress of the optimizer is displayed to the output channel of the optimizer; this information is called the search log or simply the log.">The search log</a>. Information about
the search can also be obtained using the method <samp class="ph codeph">printInformation</samp>,
a member function of the optimizer object. </p>
<p class="p">For the optimization example in the section <a class="xref" href="search_search_solveOpt.html" title="The basic search strategy in CP Optimizer can be used to solve optimization problems.">Solving an optimization problem</a>, adding a call to
the <samp class="ph codeph">printInformation</samp> method produces the
output: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Number of branches      : 3
Number of fails         : 9
Number of choice points : 10
Number of variables     : 5
Number of constraints   : 5
Total memory usage      : 345.5 Kb (331.8 Kb CP + 13.7 Kb Concert)
Time in last solve      : 0.00s (0.00s engine + 0.00s extraction)
Total time spent in CP  : 0.00s
</code></pre>
<p class="p">This output contains the number of branches (decisions)
made by the constructive strategy and the number of fails (decisions
that produced an inconsistent state). On this example there are more
failures than branches because the CP Optimizer engine has made a
few extra decisions to better guide the constructive search. The information
reported also includes the number of variables (additional variables
are those added to the optimizer to help with the search) and the
number of constraints in the problem. These values can be greater
than the number of variables and constraints in the model because
additional variables and constraints may have been added internally
when the optimizer loaded the model. Finally, the memory consumption
and some timings are reported. </p>
<p class="p">A third way of retrieving information about the search
is to use the method <samp class="ph codeph">getInfo</samp>, a member function
of the optimizer object. You can have access to search information
such as the solving time, the number of branches, the number of failures
and the memory usage. </p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">C++ API</strong> of CP Optimizer, you use
the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::getInfo</samp>. This function
takes one argument, either of type <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::NumInfo</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::IntInfo</samp>. For example, to have access to the
solving time, use the argument <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::SolveTime</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">Java™ API</strong> of
CP Optimizer, you use the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.getInfo</samp>.
This function takes one argument, either of type <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.DoubleInfo</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.IntInfo</samp>. For example, to have access to the
solving time, use the argument <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.DoubleInfo.SolveTime</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">Likewise, in the <strong class="ph b">C# API</strong> of CP Optimizer,
you use the method <samp class="ph codeph">CP.GetInfo</samp>. This function
takes one argument, either of type <samp class="ph codeph">CP.DoubleInfo</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">CP.IntInfo</samp>. For example, to have access to the solving
time, use the argument <samp class="ph codeph">CP.DoubleInfo.SolveTime</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">For an exhaustive list of information that can be accessed,
see the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::getInfo</samp> in the C++
API reference manual,<samp class="ph codeph"> IloCP.getInfo</samp> in the Java API reference manual, or <samp class="ph codeph">CP.GetInfo</samp> in the .NET languages API reference manual. </p>
