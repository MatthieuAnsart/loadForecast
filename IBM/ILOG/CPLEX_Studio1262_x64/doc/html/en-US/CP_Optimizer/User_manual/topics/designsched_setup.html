<title>Modeling sequence-dependent setup times</title>

<h1 class="title topictitle1">Modeling sequence-dependent setup times</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Setup times on disjunctive resources can be modeled by
a no-overlap constraint with a transition distance.</p>
<p class="p">It is quite common that a certain minimal amount of time
must elapse between the execution of two successive operations on
a resource (e.g. a machine), and, often, this amount of time depends
on the types of the two successive operations. This is the notion
of sequence-dependent setup time and can be captured in CP Optimizer
by a <em class="ph i">no-overlap</em> constraint
with <em class="ph i">transition distance</em>. </p>
<p class="p">Operations on the machine are represented by interval
variables a[i] and a sequence variable seq is created on these interval
variables to model the sequence of operations on the machine. The <em class="ph i">type</em> of the different operations
(used to compute the setup time) are specified when building the sequence
variable. </p>
<p class="p">A transition distance is represented by a transition
distance class and stored as a matrix of setup times. A no-overlap
constraint must be posted with the sequence variable and the transition
distance to state that interval variables of the sequence do not overlap
and that the sequence-dependent setup time of the transition distance
applies to the intervals of the sequence. </p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer distinguishes two kinds of behavior of the
no-overlap constraint with respect to transition distances: (1) transition
distance between immediate successors and (2) transition distances
between all successors. </p>
<p class="p">A transition distance between immediate successors is
generally useful for modeling the duration of a setup activity to
switch the state of the resource from one interval to the next interval
in the sequence. Here, the state of the resource is represented by
the type of the interval in the sequence. This is illustrated in Sample
1; the Boolean flag passed at the construction of the no-overlap constraint
specifies if the transition distance must only be applied between <strong class="ph b">immediate</strong> successors on the sequence
variable. A complete example of transition distance between immediate
successors is available in the delivered example <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/cpoptimizer/examples/src/cpp/sched_setup.cpp</samp>.
In some more complex cases, the setup activity will have to be explicitly
modeled as an interval variable because, for instance, it requires
some additional resource. In this case, you can use the expressions <em class="ph i">typeOfNext</em> and <em class="ph i">typeOfPrev</em> on the sequence variable
to constrain the length of the setup activity as illustrated in Sample
2. See <a class="xref" href="designsched_costs.html" title="Classical scheduling costs such as makespan, earliness/tardiness, resource allocation costs and activity execution costs can be modeled efficiently in CP Optimizer.">Modeling classical scheduling costs</a> for modeling sequence-dependent setup costs. </p>
<p class="p">In some specific cases, the transition distance must
be applied between <strong class="ph b">all</strong> pairs
of intervals succeeding each other on the sequence, no matter if there
are other intervals in between. For example, consider a set of movies
to be scheduled on a TV channel. If a movie of type <em class="ph i">ti</em> is scheduled after a movie of
type <em class="ph i">tj</em> (no matter
which other movies are shown in between), depending on the types <em class="ph i">ti,tj</em>, one would like a minimal amount
of time to elapse between the two occurrences to avoid showing movies
of similar types too close to each other. Sample 3 illustrates such
a use-case using a minimal delay <samp class="ph codeph">separationTime[ti]</samp> between
movies of type <samp class="ph codeph">ti</samp>; the Boolean flag passed
at the construction of the no-overlap constraint specifies that the
transition distance must be applied between <strong class="ph b">all</strong> successors
on the sequence variable. </p>
