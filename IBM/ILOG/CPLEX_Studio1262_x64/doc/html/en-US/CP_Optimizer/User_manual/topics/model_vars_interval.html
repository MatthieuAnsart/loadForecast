<h1 class="title topictitle1">Interval decision variables</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Interval decision variables represent intervals of time
whose positions in time are unknown.</p>
<p class="p">An <em class="ph i">interval decision variable</em> represents an unknown of a
scheduling problem, in particular an interval of time during which
something happens (an activity is carried out) whose position in time
is unknown. An <em class="ph i">interval</em> is characterized by a start value,
an end value and a size. The start and end of an interval variable
must be in <samp class="ph codeph">[IloIntervalMin..IloIntervalMax]</samp>.  An
important feature of interval decision variables is that they can
be <em class="ph i">optional</em>, that is, it is possible to model that an interval
variable can be absent from the solution schedule. </p>
<p class="p">Sometimes the intensity of “work” is not the same during the whole
interval. For example, consider a worker who does not work during
weekends (his work intensity during weekends is 0%) and on Friday
he works only for half a day (his intensity during Friday is 50%).
For this worker, 7 man-days work will span for longer than just 7
days. In this example 7 man-days represent what is called the <em class="ph i">size</em> of
the interval: that is, the length of the interval would be if the
intensity function was always at 100%.  To model such situations,
a range for the size of an interval variable and an integer stepwise
intensity function can be specified. The length of the interval will
be at least long enough to cover the work requirements given by the
interval size, taking into account the intensity function.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">C++ API</strong> of CP Optimizer, the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntervalVar</samp> represents
interval decision variables.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">Java™ API</strong> of
CP Optimizer, the interface <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntervalVar</samp> represents
interval decision variables.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">C# API</strong> of CP Optimizer, the interface <samp class="ph codeph">IIntervalVar</samp> represents
interval decision variables. </p>
<p class="p">The domain of an interval variable is displayed as shown in this
example: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>A1[0..1: 10..990 -- (5..10)5..990 --&gt; 25..1000] </code></pre>
<p class="p">After the name of the interval decision variable (here <samp class="ph codeph">A1</samp>),
the first range (here <samp class="ph codeph">0..1</samp>) represents the domain
of the Boolean presence status of the interval variable. The presence
range <samp class="ph codeph">0..1</samp> represents an optional interval variable
whose status has still not been fixed, <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp> an absent
interval variable and <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> a present interval variable.
 An absent interval variable is displayed as:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    A1[0]</code></pre>
<p class="p">When the interval variable is possibly present, the remaining fields
describe the position of the interval variable:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">the first range in the remaining fields represents the domain
of the interval start,</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the second range (between parenthesis) represents the domain
of the interval size,</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the third range represents the domain of the interval length
and </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the fourth and last range represents the domain of the interval
end.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"> Note that the second range may be omitted in case the size and
length of the interval variable are necessarily equal.   When the
values are fixed, the ranges <samp class="ph codeph">min..max</samp> are replaced
by a single value. For instance, the following display represents
a fixed interval variable of size 5 that is present, starts at 10
and ends at 35:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   A1[1: 10 -- (5)25 --&gt; 35]</code></pre>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Interval decision variable</strong></p>
 <p class="p">Interval decision
variables represent unknowns of a scheduling problem</p>
 <p class="p">An interval
has a start time, an end time, a size and a length. An interval variable
allows for these values to be variable in the model.</p>
