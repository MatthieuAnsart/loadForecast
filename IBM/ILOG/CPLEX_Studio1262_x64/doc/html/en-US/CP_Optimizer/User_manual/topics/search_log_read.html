<p class="p">The first line of the log indicates the type of problem, along
with the number of decision variables and constraints in the model.
In this case, there is an objective included in the model, so the
problem is reported to be a “Minimization problem”. When the model
does not include an objective, the problem type is reported as a “Satisfiability
problem”. The number of search phases, if any, is also displayed in
the first line. </p>
<p class="p">The second line of the log shows the result of presolve. The number
of model objects (extractables) eliminated is displayed along with
the number of constraints generated to improve the formulation of
the eliminated extractables. </p>
<p class="p">Any parameter change from its default is displayed after the preprocessing
information.</p>
<p class="p">The next three lines of the log provide information regarding the
initial constraint propagation. The “Initial process time” is the
time in seconds spent at the root node of the search tree where the
initial propagation occurs. This time encompasses the time used by
the optimizer to load the model, called extraction, and the time spent
in initial propagation. The value for “Log search space” provides
an estimate on the size of the depth-first search tree; this value
is the log (base 2) of the products of the domains sizes of all the
decision variables of the problem. Typically, the estimate of the
size of the search tree should be smaller after the initial propagation,
as choices will have been eliminated. However, this value is always
an overestimate of the log of the number of remaining leaf nodes of
the tree because it does not take into account the action of propagation
of constraints at each node. The memory used by the optimizer during
the initial propagation is reported. </p>
<p class="p">The log then display the type of search used, sequential or parallel;
in the latter case, the number of workers used is also displayed. </p>
<p class="p">In order to interpret the remainder of the log file, you may want
to think about the search as a binary tree. The root of the tree is
the starting point in the search for a solution; each branch descending
from the root represents an alternative choice or decision in the
search. Each of these branches leads to a node where constraint propagation
during search will occur. If the branch does not lead to a failure
and a solution is not found at a node, the node is called a choice
point. The optimizer can make an additional decision and create two
new alternative branches from the current node, or it can jump in
the tree and search from another node.</p>
<p class="p">The lines in the next section of the progress log are displayed
periodically during the search and describe the state of the search.
The display frequency of the progress log can be controlled with parameters
of the optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">The progress information given in a progress log update includes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Best: the value of the best solution found so far, in the case
of an optimization problem;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Branches: the number of branches explored in the binary search
tree;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Non-fixed: the number of uninstantiated (not fixed) model variables,
or the elapsed time;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">W: the id of the worker at the branch currently under consideration
by the optimizer;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Branch decision: the decision made at the branch currently
under consideration by the optimizer.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The final lines of the log provide information about the entire
search, after the search has terminated. </p>
<p class="p">Whenever a solution is found, the time is displayed in place of
the non-fixed value, which is always zero in this case.</p>
<p class="p">This information about the search includes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> Termination status line: the conditions under which the search
terminated and the number of solutions found during search;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Best objective: the value of the best solution found during
search along with the effective optimality tolerance;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Number of branches: the number of branches explored in the
binary search tree;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Number of fails: the number of branches that did not lead to
a solution;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Total memory usage: the memory used by IBM® ILOG® Concert
Technology and the CP Optimizer engine;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Time spent in solve: the elapsed time from start to the end
of the search displayed in hh:mm:ss.ff format;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Search speed: average time spent per branch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
