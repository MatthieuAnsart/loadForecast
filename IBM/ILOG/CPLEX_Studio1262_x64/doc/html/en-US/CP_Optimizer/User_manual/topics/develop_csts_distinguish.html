<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A model must distinguish constraints from preferable
conditions.</p>
<p class="p">Sometimes a specification includes conditions that the
client would like to satisfy, but that might be relaxed or dropped
if the problem proves intractable. These are the conditions that might
lead to the elimination of potential solutions if the application
insists on imposing them. At the same time, if the application fails
to take these conditions into account, the application will come up
with a "solution" that is not satisfactory in reality because these
conditions embody some fundamental and practical aspect of the problem.</p>
<p class="p">Separating these conditions from the hard constraints
of the problem accomplishes two tasks: to qualify acceptable solutions;
and to measure the quality of proposed solutions. </p>
<p class="p">This work (separating constraints from other conditions
so that the adequacy of various solutions can be compared) is often
very difficult, especially when the conditions represent social rules,
accumulated and elaborated over time, such social rules as customary
working hours, conventional combinations of tasks, habitual job assignments
and so forth. If the model ignores such conditions, the application
is likely to find unacceptable solutions; yet if the application enforces
such conditions as constraints, there may be no solution at all. In
any case, the nature of such conditions has an impact on the model
and implementation since they influence the cost function. </p>
<p class="p">These kinds of conditions (social rules, customs, conventions,
habits) depend strongly on the type of problem you are solving. Consequently,
there are few or no general guidelines that always apply. As you consider
how to manage such conditions in your application, keep in mind the
fact that CP Optimizer performs well when constraints are tight and
accurately represent conditions that cannot be violated. (Tight constraints
are those that limit the possible combinations of values of variables.)
Consequently, an approach that consists of adding quantities of terms
in the objective function is generally not a good idea.</p>
<p class="p">There are, however, various effective ways of managing
these conditions in an application of CP Optimizer.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">In some applications, it is appropriate
to represent these conditions as <em class="ph i">slack</em> which
can be pushed into the cost function.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">In some models, it is practical to start
with all possible constraints, including these conditions. If no solution
can be found, then remove the conditions one by one, until a solution
is possible.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">In other models, it is more practical
to start with a minimal set of hard constraints. Find a solution to
this minimal set of constraints. Then add conditions as constraints,
one by one, until failure occurs. Remove that last condition, the
constraint that led to failure.</p>
