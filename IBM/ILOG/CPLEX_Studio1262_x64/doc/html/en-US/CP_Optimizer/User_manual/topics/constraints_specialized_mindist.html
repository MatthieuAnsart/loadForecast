<h1 class="title topictitle1">Minimum distance constraint</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The minimum distance constraint is a specialized
constraint which forces every decision variable in a given group to
assume values which differ by at least the specified amount.</p>
<p class="p">A minimum distance constraint resembles an all different
constraint in that it accepts a group of decision variables (such
as an array of integer decision variables) and ensures that they differ
from each other. In fact, it makes sure that they differ from one
another by a given amount, so that they are at least a certain distance
apart from each other.</p>
<p class="p">For example, the decision variables <em class="ph i">x</em>, <em class="ph i">y</em> and <em class="ph i">z</em> share the domain of integers
from 1 through 10, inclusive, and the minimum distance between them
should be 3, then a minimum distance constraint applied to <em class="ph i">x</em>, <em class="ph i">y</em> and <em class="ph i">z</em> with distance 3 could return
such solutions as 1, 4, 8 or 7, 10, 4. However, 2, 4, 6 would not
be an acceptable solution because <em class="ph i">y</em> would be closer
to <em class="ph i">x</em> or <em class="ph i">z</em> than the stipulated distance.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">C++ API</strong> of CP Optimizer, the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllMinDistance</samp> represents a minimum distance
constraint.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">Java™ API</strong> of
CP Optimizer, the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.allMinDistance</samp> represents
a minimum distance constraint.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">C# API</strong> of CP Optimizer, the method <samp class="ph codeph">CP.AllMinDistance</samp> represents a minimum distance
constraint.</p>
