<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">It is important to identify all of the constraints, to
understand which ones are real ones and which have been used in the
past for tuning, and to know which ones may be relaxed.</p>
<p class="p">When you consider the aspects of a specification that
involve constraints, there are a number of important points to keep
in mind.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">You need a complete and exhaustive statement
of all the constraints, as a minimal part of the problem description. <a class="xref" href="develop_csts_define.html" title="A model must contain all of the constraints.">Define all constraints</a> offers an
example of this point.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">You need a way to identify those conditions
that your client would like to satisfy but that you may relax or drop
altogether if the problem proves intractable. Your client helps you
identify those conditions. <a class="xref" href="develop_csts_distinguish.html" title="A model must distinguish constraints from preferable conditions.">Distinguish constraints from preferable conditions</a> suggests
ways to do so.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">You must clearly separate the real constraints
from any ad hoc rules of thumb used to solve the problem in the past.
Make the real constraints part of the model, but consider whether
the ad hoc rules of thumb are still necessary. Perhaps they can be
replaced by constraint programming techniques.</p>
