a good fit.</p>
<p class="p">In spite of these common sense rules, there are many
ways to design the model and create the prototype for any given problem.
You'll need to try more than one model to find the best fit for your
problem, but don't think of these trials as wasted effort. The time
that you spend in designing the model, even time spent "playing around"
with it, is time well spent since that time will be saved later.</p>

example where experimentation is a good idea.</p>
