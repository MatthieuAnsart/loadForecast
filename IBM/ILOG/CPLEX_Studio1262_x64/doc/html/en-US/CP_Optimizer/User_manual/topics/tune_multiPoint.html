<h1 class="title topictitle1">Using multi-point search algorithms</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Multi-point search is based on a pool of points.
This pool can be managed via parameters.</p>
<p class="p">One search technique available in CP Optimizer is a multi-point
search algorithm. This algorithm is based on a pool of <em class="ph i">search
points</em>. A search point is a collection of decision variable assignments
that may lead to either feasible or partial solutions (a partial solution
has some variables which are still not fixed). The multi-point method
starts with an initial pool of search points whose candidate assignments
are generated with constructive search. It then produces new search
points by learning new variable assignments from search points maintained
in the pool. On an optimization problem, the multi-point search method
is able to learn from partial solutions in order to produce feasible
solutions.</p>
<p class="p">Multi-point search produces solutions by first performing
variable assignments proposed by each of the generated search points.
It then attempts to complete the solution by invoking a tree-search
based completion procedure. If no feasible solution can be produced,
a solution with a maximal number of instantiated decision variable
is retained.</p>
<p class="p">The completion procedure used is basically the same as
the one used by the restart method. If you have specified search phases,
the multi-point search completion procedure will use the search phases
as well. In addition, phase priorities will be respected when interpreting
search point assignments. That is, if you have specified phases A,
B and C, then, for each search point, assignments involving variables
of A will be performed at first, followed by those of phase B, ending
with those of phase C.</p>
<p class="p">The search parameter <samp class="ph codeph">MultiPointNumberOfSearchPoints</samp> controls
the number of (possibly partial) solutions manipulated by the multi-point
search algorithm. The default value is 30. A larger value will diversify
the search, with possible improvement in solution quality at the expense
of a longer run time. A smaller value will intensify the search, resulting
in faster convergence at the expense of solution quality. Note that
memory consumption increases proportionally to this parameter, for
each search point must store each decision variable domain.</p>
<p class="p">To use multipoint search in the <strong class="ph b">C++ API</strong> of
CP Optimizer, you use the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::setParameter</samp> and
the values <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::SearchType</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::MultiPoint</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::MultiPointNumberOfSearchPoints</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">To use multipoint search in the <strong class="ph b">Java™ API</strong> of CP Optimizer, you use the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.setParameter</samp> and the values <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.IntParam.SearchType</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.ParamterValues.MultiPoint</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.IntParam.MultiPointNumberOfSearchPoints</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">To use multipoint search in the <strong class="ph b">C# API</strong> of
CP Optimizer, you use the method <samp class="ph codeph">CP.SetParameter</samp> and
the values <samp class="ph codeph">CP.IntParam.SearchType</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CP.ParamterValues.MultiPoint</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">CP.IntParam.MultiPointNumberOfSearchPoints</samp>.</p>
