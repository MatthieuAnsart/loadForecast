<h1 class="title topictitle1">Catching exceptions</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Exception handling for managing anomalies is a
good programming practice when using CP Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">When programming an application, it is a good programming
practice to enclose parts of your application in try-catch statements.
In that way, when anomalies arise during execution, they can be managed
as exceptions, so that your application can recover as cleanly as
possible. You will find samples of try-catch statements in the examples
distributed with CP Optimizer. </p>
<p class="p">If you use try-catch statements, it is possible to distinguish
exceptions raised by CP Optimizer from exceptions raised by the rest
of the application. Specifically, when an error condition is encountered,
CP Optimizer raises an exception of type <samp class="ph codeph">IloException. </samp>Your
application can catch these exceptions within try-catch statements,
and you can thus determine directly whether the anomaly arises within
the CP Optimizer part of your application or in another part of your
application. Here’s the conventional way to catch an error exception
from CP Optimizer in the C++ API:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>catch (IloException&amp; e) {
  ...
  e.end();
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The reference manual documents exceptions specific to IBM® ILOG® Concert
Technology and CP Optimizer.  </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Catch exceptions by reference</strong> </p>
 <p class="p">Catch exceptions by reference, not by value, to avoid losing
information and to prevent leaks from expressions or arrays. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">In the C++ API, exception classes are not handle classes.
Thus, the correct type of an exception is lost if it is caught by
value rather than by reference (that is, using <samp class="ph codeph">catch(IloException&amp;
e) {...}</samp>). This is one reason that catching <samp class="ph codeph">IloException</samp> objects
by reference is a good idea, as demonstrated in all the examples distributed
with CP Optimizer. Some derived exceptions may carry information that
would be lost if caught by value. So if you output an exception caught
by reference, you may get a more precise message than when outputting
the same exception caught by value.</p>
<p class="p">There is a second reason for catching exceptions by reference.
Some exceptions contain arrays to communicate the reason for the failure
to the calling function. If this information were lost by calling
the exception by value, the method <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> could
not be called for such arrays, and their memory would be leaked (until <samp class="ph codeph">env.end</samp> is called). After catching an exception
by reference, calling the <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> method of
the exception will free all the memory that may be used by arrays
(or expressions) of the actual exception that was thrown. </p>
<p class="p">You can also control where warnings and error messages
of the CP Optimizer part of your application are displayed. For example,
during debugging, you might want all warning or error messages directed
to your monitor, whereas when your application goes into production
for use by customers, for example, you might want to direct warnings
and error messages to a log file or some other discreet channel. </p>
<p class="p">In the C++ API of Concert Technology, the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloEnv</samp> initializes output streams for general information,
for error messages and for warnings. The class <samp class="ph codeph">IloAlgorithm</samp> supports
these communication streams and the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp> inherits
its methods. For general output, there is the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloAlgorithm::out</samp>.
For warnings and nonfatal conditions, there is the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloAlgorithm::warning</samp>. For errors, there is the
method <samp class="ph codeph">IloAlgorithm::error</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">In the C++ API, an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloEnv</samp> defines
the output stream referenced by the method out as the system <samp class="ph codeph">cout</samp> in the C++ API, but you can use the method <samp class="ph codeph">setOut</samp> to redefine it as you prefer. For example,
to suppress output to the screen in a C++ application, use this method
with this argument:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>setOut(IloEnv::getNullStream())
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Likewise, you can use the methods <samp class="ph codeph">IloAlgorithm::setWarning</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">setError</samp> to redefine those channels as you prefer.</p>
<p class="p">In the Microsoft .NET
Framework languages and Java™ APIs,
the native streams are used directly.</p>
