<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The basic building blocks of scheduling include time
intervals and the constraints amongst those intervals.</p>
<p class="p">In addition to constrained integer variables, CP Optimizer
provides a set of modeling features for applications dealing with
scheduling over time. Although in CP Optimizer, time points are represented
as integers, time is effectively continuous because the range of time
points is potentially very wide.</p>
<p class="p">A consequence of scheduling over effectively continuous
time is that the evolution of some known quantities over time (for
instance the instantaneous efficiency/speed of a resource or the earliness/tardiness
cost for finishing an activity at a given date) needs to be compactly
represented in the model. </p>
<p class="p">Most of the scheduling applications consist of scheduling
in time a set of activities, tasks or operations that have a start
and an end time. In CP Optimizer, this type of decision variable is
captured by the notion of <em class="ph i">interval
decision variable</em>.  </p>
<p class="p"> Several types of constraints are expressed on and between
interval decision variables:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> to limit the possible positions of
an interval decision variable (forbidden start/end or “extent”
values),</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">to specify precedence relations between
two interval decision variables and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> to relate the position of an interval
variable with one of a set of interval decision variables (such as
with spanning, synchronization, or alternative constraints).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An important characteristic of scheduling problems is
that intervals may be optional and whether to execute an interval
or not may be a decision variable. In CP Optimizer, this is captured
by the notion of a Boolean presence status associated with each interval
decision variable. Logical relations can be expressed between the
presence of interval variables, for instance to state that whenever
interval <em class="ph i">a</em> is present
then interval <em class="ph i">b</em> must
also be present.</p>
<p class="p">Another aspect of scheduling is the allocation of limited
resources to time intervals. The evolution of a resource over time
can be modeled by three types of decision variables and expressions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The evolution of a disjunctive resource
over time can be described by the sequence of intervals that represent
the activities executing on the resource. CP Optimizer introduces
the notion of an <em class="ph i">interval sequence
variable</em>. Constraints and expressions are available
to control the sequencing of a set of interval variables.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The evolution of a cumulative resource
often needs a description of how the resource accumulated usage evolves
over time. CP Optimizer provides <em class="ph i">cumul
function expressions</em> that can be used to constrain
the evolution of resource usage over time.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The evolution of a resource of infinite
capacity, the state of which can vary over time is captured in CP
Optimizer by <em class="ph i">state functions</em>.
The dynamic evolution of a state function can be controlled using
transition distances and constraints for specifying conditions on
the state function that must be satisfied during fixed or variable
intervals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Some classical cost functions in scheduling are earliness/tardiness
costs, makespan and activities execution/non-execution costs. CP Optimizer
generalizes these classical cost functions and provides a set of basic
expressions that can be combined together to express a large spectrum
of scheduling cost functions that can be efficiently exploited by
the CP Optimizer search.</p>
