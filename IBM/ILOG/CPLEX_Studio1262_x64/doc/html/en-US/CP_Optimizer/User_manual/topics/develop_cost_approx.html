<h1 class="title topictitle1">Approximate the cost function</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">In some cases, it may be best to approximate the cost
function.</p>
<p class="p">The client for your application may supply, as part of
the specification, a cost function that takes into account various
complex measures of solution quality from a business point of view.
Since it is familiar and business-like, your client may expect to
see results in terms of this cost function, as he or she already understands
this measure.</p>
<p class="p">However, cost functions coming from clients may not necessarily
be the best way to get good solutions to an optimization problem.
In such situations, a <em class="ph i">proxy</em> for
the cost function supplied by the client may be a better way to proceed.</p>
<p class="p">The idea behind this advice is that the proxy approximates
the cost function supplied by the client. The proxy should correspond
closely to the client-supplied cost function, but it should be significantly
more amenable to optimization with constraint programming. CP Optimizer
will optimize the proxy to produce a good solution. However, the client
need never see this proxy, as you can write code in your application
to calculate his or her preferred cost function from the solution
produced by the proxy.</p>
<p class="p">As an example of a good place to use a proxy instead
of a client-supplied cost function, consider the nursing roster again.
In order to limit the number of times that a given nurse must work
at night, it is conventional in some rostering applications to use
a Big-M formulation, where a counting variable with a very large maximal
value is introduced as part of the cost function. A better approach
is to add a constraint that limits the maximum value of this counting
variable, instead of adding this parameter in the cost function.</p>
