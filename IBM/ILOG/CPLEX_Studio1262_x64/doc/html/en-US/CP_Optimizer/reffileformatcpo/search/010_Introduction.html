<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Some models have structures that are particularly well-understood by the user.
It is possible to help CP Optimizer exploit these structures during the search
and achieve much better solving times. In these cases, it is possible to
adjust the automatic search in CP Optimizer using <em class="ph i">search phases</em> in
order to use the problem
structures.</p>
<div class="section">
<p class="p">For instance, assume we have a model over two groups of variables
<samp class="ph codeph">x1, x2, x3, x4, x5</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">y1, y2, y3</samp>. The following search section:</p>


<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><a class="xref" href="../search.html" title="A CPO file may contain an optional search section which specifies a variable fixing strategy that CP Optimizer should use while searching for solutions. The strategy is described by search phases.">search</a> {
  <a class="xref" href="080_searchPhase.html" title="The function searchPhase defines an variable fixing strategy.">searchPhase</a>([x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]);
  <a class="xref" href="080_searchPhase.html" title="The function searchPhase defines an variable fixing strategy.">searchPhase</a>([y1, y2, y3]);
}</code></pre>

<p class="p">specifies that the variables <samp class="ph codeph">x1, x2, x3, x4</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">x5</samp> will be
fixed before the variables <samp class="ph codeph">y1</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">y2</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">y3</samp>, although the
fixing order among the <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp> variables and <samp class="ph codeph">y</samp> variables is not specified here.</p>


<p class="p">The order of the search phases is important. The variables will
be fixed phase by phase in the order in which they appear. It is not necessary for
the variables in the search phases cover all the variables of the problem.  If
any variables remain unfixed after all of the phases have been executed, then CP
Optimizer's automatic search will continue to attempt to fix the remainder.</p>
