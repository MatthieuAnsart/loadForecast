<h1 class="title topictitle1">Pushing constraints</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Pushing constraints makes it possible that a constraint
is not propagated after each modification of each decision variable;
rather, it is propagated after all its variables have been propagated.</p>
<p class="p">Suppose that there is a constraint <em class="ph i">C</em> involving the decision variables <em class="ph i">x</em>, <em class="ph i">y</em>, <em class="ph i">z</em> and <em class="ph i">t</em>.
Suppose that x is modified, then <em class="ph i">C</em> is
propagated. Now if the modification of x leads to a modification of <em class="ph i">y</em>, <em class="ph i">z</em> and <em class="ph i">t</em>, then these decision variables
will be propagated and each of those variables will propagate <em class="ph i">C</em> again, even if these variables
have not been modified by constraints other than <em class="ph i">C</em>.</p>
<p class="p">Imagine that you want to avoid these repeated propagations
because you know that the <samp class="ph codeph">propagate</samp> member
function of <em class="ph i">C</em> is
costly. Also imagine that you want to propagate <em class="ph i">C</em> once for all the modifications
of the variables involved in <em class="ph i">C</em> but
not for the modifications of each variable individually. </p>
<p class="p">There is a mechanism in CP Optimizer that meets these
aims. It is possible to have constraints that are not propagated within
demons. Such a constraint is not propagated after each modification
of each decision variable; rather, it is propagated after all its
variables have been propagated.</p>
<p class="p">In fact, in CP Optimizer there are two mechanisms for
propagating the modifications of variables.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">First Level: When a decision variable
is modified, all the demons linked to this variable are called. This
mechanism is repeated while there is a variable for which all the
demons have not yet been called. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Second Level: The <samp class="ph codeph">propagate</samp> function
of some constraint known as a global constraint is called. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If, after the termination of a <samp class="ph codeph">propagate</samp> member
function, a variable has been modified, then constraint propagation
immediately return to the first level. This means that the process
at the first level has greatest priority.</p>
<p class="p">In the second level, a global constraint (say, <samp class="ph codeph">ct</samp>)
is pushed by a call to the <samp class="ph codeph">push</samp> member
function.</p>
<p class="p">This member function indicates to CP Optimizer that <samp class="ph codeph">ct</samp> is
a global constraint and must be propagated by the second level mechanism.
This member function must be called within a demon.</p>
<p class="p">Consider the following example simplified for illustration:
you want to define the constraint <em class="ph i">x
+ y = s</em> without considering modifications of <em class="ph i">s</em>. </p>
<p class="p">The code of that constraint could be something like this:
   </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>class MySumConstraintI : public IlcConstraintI {
    IlcIntVar _x, _y, _s;
public:
    MySumConstraintI(IloCP cp, IlcIntVar x, IlcIntVar y, IlcIntVar s);
    ~MySumConstraintI(){}; // empty destructor

    virtual void propagate ();
    virtual void post();
    void pushDemon();
};
</code></pre>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>void MySumConstraintI::propagate () {
  IlcInt m;
  // compute the min of s
  m =_x.getMin() + _y.getMin();
  _s.setMin(m);
  // compute the max of s
  m=_x.getMax() + _y.getMax();
  _s.setMax(m);
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">A demon for each variable <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">y</samp> is
added and that demon is triggered when the boundary of either variable
is modified (that is, when a range event occurs).  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>void MySumConstraintI::post(){
  _x.whenRange(MySumConstraintI_pushDemon(getCP(),this));
  _y.whenRange(MySumConstraintI_pushDemon(getCP(),this));
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Now here is the code for the demon: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILCCTDEMON0(MySumConstraintI_pushDemon, MySumConstraintI, pushDemon);
void MySumConstraintI::pushDemon() {
  push();
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">How does this tactic differ from the conventional propagation
mechanism? In this case, the demon will be called, but the propagate
member function of <samp class="ph codeph">MySumConstraintI</samp> will
not be called immediately. Rather, <samp class="ph codeph">ct</samp> is
pushed. When there are no more demons to trigger, then the constraints
that have been pushed will be called. Furthermore, in this way, a
constraint will be propagated only once even if it has been pushed
several times.</p>
<p class="p">If you want to refine the propagation mechanism, for
example, if you want to treat the variables that have been modified
in a special way, you have to manage that treatment by using internal
data structures within the constraint. For example, suppose that if <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp> is
modified, you want to call your own function <samp class="ph codeph">propagateX()</samp> and
if <samp class="ph codeph">y</samp> has been modified, you want to call
your own <samp class="ph codeph">propagateY()</samp>. To do so, you add
reversible Boolean data members to <samp class="ph codeph">MySumConstraintI</samp>,
like this: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IlcRevBool _xIsModified;
    IlcRevBool _yIsModified;
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Now you define special demons for <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp> and
for <samp class="ph codeph">y</samp>, like this: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILCCTDEMON0(MySumConstraintI_xDemon, MySumConstraintI, xDemon);
ILCCTDEMON0(MySumConstraintI_yDemon, MySumConstraintI, yDemon);
void MySumConstraintI::xDemon() {
  memorizeThatXisModified();
  push();
}
void MySumConstraintI::yDemon() {
  memorizeThatYisModified();
  push();
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Now the propagate member function will look like this:
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>void MySumConstraintI::propagateX () {
  IlcInt m;
  // compute the min of s
  m =_x.getMin() + _y.getMin();
  _s.setMin(m);
  // compute the max of s
  m=_x.getMax() + _y.getMax();
  _s.setMax(m);
}
void MySumConstraintI::propagateY () {
  IlcInt m;
  // compute the min of s
  m =_x.getMin() + _y.getMin();
  _s.setMin(m);
  // compute the max of s
  m=_x.getMax() + _y.getMax();
  _s.setMax(m);
}
void MySumConstraintI::propagate(){
  if (_xIsModified){
    propagateX();
    _xIsModified.setValue(getCP(),IlcFalse);
  }
  if (_yIsModified){
    propagateY();
    _yIsModified.setValue(getCP(),IlcFalse);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Thus you have created a global constraint that will be
propagated only once and propagated only after the propagation of
variables in that constraint. </p>
