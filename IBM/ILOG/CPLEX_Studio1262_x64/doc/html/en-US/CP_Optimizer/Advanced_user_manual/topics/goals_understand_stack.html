<h1 class="title topictitle1">Goal stack</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The goal stack determines the order of execution of the
goals.</p>
<p class="p">The member functions <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::solve</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::next</samp> control
the execution of goals. The first time one of these member functions
is called, it creates a stack of goals, called the <em class="ph i">goal stack</em>.    </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">Goals must be called by <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::solve</samp>,
a <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::startNewSearch</samp>/<samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::next</samp> pair,
or by other goals. Otherwise, they are not executed.  </p>
</div>
<p class="p">At the Concert Technology level, an instance of an <samp class="ph codeph">IloGoal</samp> is
passed as an argument to the member functions <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::solve</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::startNewSearch</samp>.
The function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::solve</samp> pushes the corresponding
search layer goal onto the goal stack of the invoking <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp> optimizer
object and then executes the subgoal at the top of the stack. The
function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::startNewSearch</samp> pushes the
corresponding search layer goal onto the goal stack of the invoking <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp> optimizer
object, but does not execute it immediately. The member function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::next</samp> pops
the goal which is on top of the goal stack, if any, and executes it.
In both cases, when the current goal execution is finished, the goal
at the top of the stack is popped and executed. Thus goals are executed
in the order first in, last out. If the goal stack is empty, the call
to <samp class="ph codeph">solve</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">next</samp> terminates
and returns <samp class="ph codeph">IloTrue</samp>. </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">For goals composed of conjunctions (subgoals joined with <samp class="ph codeph">IlcAnd</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">operator&amp;&amp;</samp>),
they subgoals are pushed onto the goal stack starting with the rightmost
goal in the sequence. </p>
