<p class="p">When solving scheduling problems, the main difficulty
is often fixing sequence variables with no overlap constraints. For
these types of problems, a good practice is to build the subsequences
before scheduling the sequenced interval variables. An advantage of
this practice is that the decisions to make are fixing the presence
of the intervals and fixing the immediate successor of the intervals
in the sequence; that is, the decisions depend only on the number
of intervals and are enumerable. To build a chronological schedule,
the Head-Tail graph of sequence variables is perfectly suited. The
example <samp class="ph codeph">schedsearch_sequencing.cpp</samp> illustrates
how to interleave sequencing decisions and schedule building. This
sample is based on the classical academic problem called the Job Shop
Scheduling Problem (JSSP); it is a simple example for which a greedy
scheduling algorithm is enough to build the schedule. Each interval
variable is constrained by precedences and belongs to a sequence (with
alternative of sequence). The sample shows how to use the Head-Tail
Graph of a sequence to implement a sequencing algorithm and how to
interleave non-scheduling decisions (here sequencing) and partial
scheduling completion.   </p>
