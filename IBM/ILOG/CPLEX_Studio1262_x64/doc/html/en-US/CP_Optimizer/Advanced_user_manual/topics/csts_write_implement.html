<h1 class="title topictitle1">Implementation classes and handles</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A handle class contains an object that is a pointer to
an instance of the corresponding implementation class.</p>
<p class="p">For a predefined CP Optimizer class, <samp class="ph codeph">IlcConstraintI</samp>,
implementing an object with its own data members and virtual functions,
CP Optimizer defines the handle class <samp class="ph codeph">IlcConstraint</samp>.
Essentially, such a handle class contains objects that are simply
pointers to instances of the corresponding implementation class <samp class="ph codeph">IlcConstraintI</samp>.
When you extend CP Optimizer by defining a new implementation class,
you must also define a function that returns a handle. </p>
<p class="p">This rule applies particularly to the definition of new
classes of constraints. Handles for constraints are instances of the
class <samp class="ph codeph">IlcConstraint</samp>. This class provides
an instance of an implementation class, or more precisely, <samp class="ph codeph">IlcConstraintI*</samp>.
You must define a function that returns a handle, and the minimal
service that the handle provides is to manage the memory allocation
of instances in your implementation class. The form that it generally
takes looks like this:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IlcConstraint MyConstraint( /* arguments for the constraint */){
        // get the optimizer from a variable
        return new (cp.getHeap()) MyConstraintI(cp, /* ...args... */);
}</code></pre>
<p class="p">The body of that function builds an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">MyConstraintI</samp> by
calling the constructor and allocates a place on the CP Optimizer
heap by calling the overloaded operator, <samp class="ph codeph">new (cp.getHeap()
... )</samp>. When you use this CP Optimizer <samp class="ph codeph">new</samp>,
you get an efficient allocator that automatically manages how memory
is recovered in case of backtracking. </p>
<p class="p">In the example, <em class="ph i">x !=
y</em>, you write a function <samp class="ph codeph">DiffConstraint</samp> which
creates the constraint. Here's the code for it:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IlcConstraint DiffConstraint(IlcIntExp x, IlcIntExp y){
  IloCP cp = x.getCP();
    return new (cp.getHeap()) DiffConstraintI(cp, x, y);
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">That definition, of course, has two parts: the implementation
and the handle. To use this new constraint within the search, you
simply write: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   cp.add(DiffConstraint(x, y));</code></pre>
<p class="p">This statement informs CP Optimizer to take the constraint
into account within such mechanisms as propagation, backtracking and
so forth. In general, it can be said that a call to <samp class="ph codeph">DiffConstraint</samp> as
written builds an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">DiffConstraintI</samp> and
returns a handle for that object (in other words, an encapsulation
of the object) to post by means of the <samp class="ph codeph">post</samp> member
function. The instance of the implementation class is connected to
the value events of the two decision variables. Every time these variables
are fixed, the <samp class="ph codeph">propagate</samp> member function
is executed. </p>
