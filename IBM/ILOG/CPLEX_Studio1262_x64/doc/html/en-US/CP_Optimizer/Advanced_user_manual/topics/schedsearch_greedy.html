<h1 class="title topictitle1">Writing a greedy search</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A simple example is used to illustrate custom search
for scheduling.</p>
<p class="p">The example <samp class="ph codeph">schedsearch_greedandrelax.cpp</samp> illustrates
the design aspects of writing your own search by showing you how to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">write a search that builds a chronological
schedule with a very simple search that does not have a branch and
bound tree traversal;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">write a dynamic selector for chronological
list scheduling of the interval variables which only considers variables
that are the actual decision variables;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">use the internal solve method of the
instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp> to iterate on schedule
building procedures. This is a key point as writing an iterative improvement
 method follows the same principle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">To define a new  search, you will have to create at least
two separate sets of data. The first set of data, the model context,
collects the information you need from the model, such as the instances
of <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntervalVar</samp> that need to be fixed,
as well as all the structural and invariant information that may be
needed to build the search. This set of data should be allocated on
the <samp class="ph codeph">IloEnv</samp> instance or by your own allocator.
The second set of data, the engine context, contains all of the information
that is used by the search algorithm to define the tree traversal
and, eventually, the constraints that you may add to the solving engine.
The engine context contains the counterparts of the model variables
that are needed during the search (for example instances of <samp class="ph codeph">IlcIntervalVar</samp>),
a local copy of all structural and invariant information you may need
to build the search and that may change during the search as well
as reversible data (instances of <samp class="ph codeph">IlcRevInt</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IlcRevAny</samp>).
This data set is allocated on the heap of the optimizer, the <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp> instance.
The model context should never be used in the search, since the model
environment data is not under the control of the solving engine. Conversely,
the engine context must never point to data allocated outside of heap
of the instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp>. An instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloGoal</samp> in
the model context should be wrapped in a goal wrapper that returns
an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGoa</samp>l. The instance of
the <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGoal</samp> is created in the engine context
and can be used to launch the search tree traversal.  This design
is strongly recommended as it clearly separates the data from the
model declaration and the data structure of the solving procedure.
