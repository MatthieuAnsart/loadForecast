<h1 class="title topictitle1">Writing a goal with interval variables</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Custom search goals enable you to write your own search
strategy.</p>
<p class="p">The basic principles involved in writing a goal involving
instances of <samp class="ph codeph">IlcIntervalVar</samp> include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">building a chronological schedule by
fixing the start point and, eventually the end point after candidate
selection at the frontier of the partial schedule;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">interleave a goal that raises precedences
or extends sequences with a chronological schedule decision.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The primary reason for developing your own search goal
is the recognition of global knowledge of the model which allows you
to build an efficient search. In practice, there generally exist instances
of interval variables whose fixing depend on the fixing of some other
interval variables. The classic example of this dependence in CP Optimizer
is the master interval of a spanning or alternative constraint; a
master interval is fixed whenever the spanned or in alternative intervals
are fixed. Chronological schedule building decisions should not be
made on this type of master interval. The master intervals are dominated
for decision building, and the spanned or alternative intervals are
dominant in decision building.  Due to specific knowledge of your
problem, you will be aware that there are some intervals whose fixing
heavily depends upon some dominant intervals; that is, they are essentially
dominated. In schedule building, you should wait for the dominant
intervals to be fixed before making any (residual) decisions on the
dominated interval. </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">Note that when the presence of an interval is not fixed,
a general strategy is to decide its presence value before scheduling
it.</p>
