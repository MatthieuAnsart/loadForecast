<h1 class="title topictitle1">The constraint propagation algorithm</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The constraint propagation algorithm is straightforward
in principle. When the domain of a decision variable is modified,
the constraints containing that variable are examined to determine
whether any values in the domains of other decision variables are
now inconsistent.</p>
<p class="p">To see how the propagation algorithm works with constraints,
consider the constraint x &lt;= y, written with the following fragment
of code:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IlcIntVar x(cp,0,3), y(cp,0,2); 
  cp.add( x &lt;= y ); </code></pre>
<p class="p">When this constraint is added to the optimizer, the invariant
expressed in the previous section becomes active and reduces the domain
of x by removing the value 3. For the moment, that is all that can
be deduced from the constraint. Since the constraint has to be taken
into account by CP Optimizer every time one of the variables in it
is modified, the constraint itself is physically attached to these
two variables. </p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer has been designed to automate and to optimize
the reduction of the domains of decision variables. The CP Optimizer
propagation algorithm for that purpose is straightforward in principle.
When the domain of a decision variable is modified, the constraints
containing that variable are examined to determine whether any values
in the domains of other decision variables are now inconsistent. If
this is the case, necessary domain reductions are carried out in turn. </p>
<p class="p">The examination of the constraints incident on a variable
is triggered by any modification of that variable. There are several
different kinds of modifications, depending on the class of variable
under consideration. Those modifications are referred to as propagation
events. </p>
<p class="p">For the class of decision variables, there are, in fact,
these propagation events: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">value</strong> means
that a value has been assigned to the decision variable, that is,
the variable has been fixed; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">range</strong> indicates
that the minimum of the domain has increased or the maximum of the
domain has decreased;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">domain</strong> indicates
that the domain of the decision variable has been modified. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When you define a new class of constraint, you must also
define the propagation events for that class of constraint. You do
so by means of the pure virtual member function, <samp class="ph codeph">post</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">Sometimes more than one event can be triggered after
a variable modification. Specifically, the value event is always accompanied
by the range and domain events. Likewise, a range event is always
accompanied by a domain event. </p>
<p class="p">Consider a search decision variable, <em class="ph i">var</em>, with a domain containing only
two values, <em class="ph i">value1</em> and <em class="ph i">value2</em>, where <em class="ph i">value1 &lt; value2</em>. If you add a
constraint that <em class="ph i">var != value1</em>,
three events are triggered: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">the domain event is triggered since <em class="ph i">value1</em> is actually removed from the
domain of <em class="ph i">var</em>; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the range event is triggered since the
minimal boundary of the domain of <em class="ph i">var</em> has
been increased; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the value event is triggered since the
variable is fixed by the reduction of its domain to a single value. </p>
</li>
</ul>
