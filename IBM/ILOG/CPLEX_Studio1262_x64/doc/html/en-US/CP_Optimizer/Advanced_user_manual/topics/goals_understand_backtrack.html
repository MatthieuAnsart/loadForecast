<h1 class="title topictitle1">Backtracking</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Backtracking occurs when there is a failure in a goal
and goal execution resumes at the most recent choice point with untried
subgoals.</p>
<p class="p">Within CP Optimizer search, the implicit generation of
combinations of values for decision variables uses <em class="ph i">constructive search strategies</em>. A
constructive strategy attempts to build a solution by choosing a non-fixed
decision variable and a value for this variable. The chosen variable
is then fixed to the chosen value and constraint propagation is triggered.
This operation is called <em class="ph i">branching</em>,
and the fixing is also called a “branch”. Constraint
propagation then reduces the domains of variables and, consequently,
the currently possible combinations. After propagation terminates,
another non-fixed variable, if one exists, is chosen, and the process
repeats until all decision variables are fixed. However, if a fixing
fails because it cannot lead to a solution, the constructive strategy <em class="ph i">backtracks</em> and chooses another value
for the variable.</p>
<p class="p">The fixing of a decision variable must be seen as a guess:
if it leads to inconsistencies, it should be undone, and another value
should be tried. CP Optimizer implements these guesses and “undos”
by using choice points. Choice points are implemented at the search
level in CP Optimizer by the function <samp class="ph codeph">IlcOr</samp>.
A choice point defines a goal in terms of a choice between subgoals. </p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer executes a choice point between two or more
subgoals like this: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The state of CP Optimizer (including
the state of all variables and constraints and the state of the goal
stack) is saved, so that it can be restored if needed. This is called
setting the <em class="ph i">choice point</em>. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The first subgoal is pushed onto the
top of the goal stack. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The other subgoals are saved as untried
subgoals for the choice point. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Then the first subgoal is popped from
the goal stack and executed. If this subgoal fails, the state of CP
Optimizer is restored, and the first untried choice is pushed onto
the goal stack. This activity is called backtracking, and it continues
until a subgoal is found that succeeds. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If all subgoals fail, the choice point
itself fails. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::fail</samp> is
called, goal execution resumes at the most recent choice point with
untried subgoals. It is possible to make goal execution resume at
an earlier choice point if you associate labels with choice points.
Then the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::fail</samp> can be called
with a label. In such a case, goal execution resumes at the most recent
choice point having the same label. </p>
