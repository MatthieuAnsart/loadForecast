<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Before writing a custom constraint, predefined
constraints and constraint propagators should be investigated. If
these do not provide the necessary flexibility, then custom constraints
can be used to link specific decision variables.</p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer offers a wide range of predefined constraints,
together with powerful logical operators for combining them. These
facilities usually suffice for expressing even the most specific constraints.
However, when you are modeling your problem, a predefined constraint
which implements your knowledge of the problem may not exist. In this
case, you may find it useful to write a constraint propagator. A constraint
propagator is a simple way to define a custom constraint, that is,
one where you define the domain reduction rules via some C++ or Java™ code. Constraint propagators
are discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="propagator.html" title="A constraint propagator is a simple way to define a custom constraint, that is, one where you define the domain reduction rules.">Using constraint propagators</a> .</p>
<p class="p">However, there may be cases in which a constraint propagator
does not provide enough flexibility. For instance, it may be that
you need to solve a subproblem within the execution of the inference
algorithm of your constraint.</p>
<p class="p">Or it may be that be that you want to have different operations
which depend on how the domain of the triggering variable has been
modified; you may not want to call the propagator for each modification
but only when the decision variable is fixed.</p>
<p class="p">Or it may be that you may want to be able to implement
an efficient algorithm in a incremental way, so you need to know which
are the values that have been currently modified; these values are
known as the delta domains).</p>
<p class="p">When you write a new constraint class to link certain
decision variables, you must implement the inference algorithm that
eliminates from the domains of the variables the values that could
not participate in a solution. These reductions are carried out by
means of <em class="ph i">elementary modifiers</em> on the domains of these
variables.</p>
