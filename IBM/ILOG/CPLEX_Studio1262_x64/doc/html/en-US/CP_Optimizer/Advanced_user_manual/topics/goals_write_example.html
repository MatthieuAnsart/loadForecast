<h1 class="title topictitle1">Example of writing your own goal: implementing IlcInstantiate</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The instantiation goal is used as an example of writing
your own goal.</p>
<p class="p">As an example of goal programming, you are going to look
closely at how the function <samp class="ph codeph">IlcInstantiate</samp> is
implemented. This function takes a decision variable as its argument
and fixes it. More precisely, this function selects a value in the
domain of the decision variable and assigns that value to the decision
variable. The CP Optimizer engine automatically propagates the constraints
incident on this decision variable. </p>
<p class="p">With the ideas about choice points and backtracking that
you have just learned in mind, now you can implement a goal that is
similar to <samp class="ph codeph">IlcInstantiate</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">To do so, you will use the following algorithm: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">If the decision variable is fixed (that
is, it has already been assigned a value), do nothing and succeed. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Otherwise, set a choice point between
two subgoals. If a selector is specified, the first subgoal assigns
a valued based on the selection criteria. Otherwise, the minimum value
of the current domain of the decision variable is assigned to it. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If a contradiction is detected (the
domain of a decision variable is reduced to the empty set), execute
the second subgoal of the choice point. The second subgoal removes
the tried and failed value from the domain of the constrained variable
and executes the goal again. Indeed, this execution will try another
value from the domain of the decision variable and repeat the process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Assigning a value to (or removing a value from the domain
of) a decision variable is straightforward. To do so, use the CP Optimizer
constraint operators <samp class="ph codeph">==</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">!=</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">The CP Optimizer code corresponding to <samp class="ph codeph">IlcInstantiate</samp> for
decision variables is quite simple. You will see a couple versions
of it to clarify a few points about goals. </p>
<p class="p">To define a goal, you use a macro of the form <samp class="ph codeph">ILCGOALn</samp>,
where <samp class="ph codeph">n</samp> is the number of arguments of the
goal. The arguments of <samp class="ph codeph">ILCGOALn</samp> are the
name of the goal, followed by the types and names of the goal's arguments.
Then the macro is followed by the body of a C++ function. This body
defines how to execute the goal. The return value of that function
is the subgoal of the goal defined by the macro itself. When there
are no such subgoals, the function must return 0. </p>
<p class="p">Now you can define <samp class="ph codeph">MycInstantiate</samp> as
a choice point between two goals. </p>
<p class="p">Before setting a choice point, CP Optimizer checks whether
the decision variable has been fixed, and if not, CP Optimizer selects
a value in its domain. The second subgoal recursively calls <samp class="ph codeph">IlcInstantiate</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">Here is a first version of <samp class="ph codeph">MycInstantiate</samp>:
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILCGOAL1(MycInstantiate, IlcIntVar, var) {
  if (var.isFixed())
    return 0;
  IlcInt value = var.getMin();
  return IlcOr( var == value,
                IlcAnd( var != value,
                        MycInstantiate(getCP(), var)));
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">As the <samp class="ph codeph">ILCGOALn</samp> macros define
classes of <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGoalI</samp>, you can use the standard
C++ keyword <samp class="ph codeph">this</samp> to refer to the current
goal. With that possibility in mind, here is a second version of <samp class="ph codeph">MycInstantiate</samp>:
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILCGOAL1(MycInstantiate, IlcIntVar, var) {
  if (var.isFixed())
    return 0;
  IlcInt value = var.getMin();
  return IlcOr( var == value,
                IlcAnd( var != value,
                        this));
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">(The actual implementation of the predefined goal <samp class="ph codeph">IlcInstantiate</samp> is
slightly different since the choice of the value can be indicated
by a parameter, but these two versions indicate the substance of the
implementation.) </p>
<p class="p">If you want to have an <samp class="ph codeph">IloGoal</samp> object
that can then be passed as an argument to the <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::solve</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP:startNewSearch</samp> functions,
use the macro <samp class="ph codeph">ILOCPGOALWRAPPER1</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">For example, you can define <samp class="ph codeph">MyoInstantiate</samp> this
way:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILOCPGOALWRAPPER1(MyoInstantiate, cp, IloIntVar, x){
  return MycInstantiate(cp, cp.getIntVar(x));
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To create an instance of this modeling layer goal you
write:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloGoal goal = MyoInstantiate(env, x);</code></pre>
