<h1 class="title topictitle1">Working with interval variables</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Scheduling constraints in the engine are built using
the interval variables in the engine.</p>
<p class="p">The primary reason for developing a custom search goal
is the recognition of global knowledge of the model which allows for
an efficient search to be built:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The requirements of the problem do not
fit with the automatic search, for example, in the sample <samp class="ph codeph">schedsearch_greedyrelax.cpp</samp>,
the objective is to build the schedule greedily at each step of the
relaxation.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The automatic search does not find a
good enough solution to efficiently start the automatic optimization
procedure. The solution the user-defined goal is then used as starting
point for the optimization.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">You want to write a sophisticated search
procedure. Examples of this, given in an academic context, are studies
of search procedures which take advantage of the propagation  algorithm,
the reversibility properties and the search tree traversal delivered
by CP Optimizer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The basic principles useful in writing a goal involving
instances of <samp class="ph codeph">IlcIntervalVar</samp> include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">building a chronological schedule by
fixing the starting point and, eventually, the end point after candidate
selection at the frontier of the partial schedule and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">interleave a goal that raises precedences
or extends sequences with a chronological schedule decision. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An important point when writing a user-defined search
procedure is fixing the presence of an interval.  A general strategy
is to decide its presence value before scheduling it (or making any
actual decision that affects the interval domain).  </p>
<p class="p">In a model, there exist instances of interval (or integer)
variables whose fixing depend on the fixing  of some other interval
and integer variables. The classic example of this dependence in CP
Optimizer is the master interval of a spanning or alternative constraint;
a master interval is fixed whenever the spanned or alternative intervals
are fixed. Chronological schedule building decisions should not be
made on this type of master interval. Eventually, due to specific
knowledge of the problem, you are aware that there are some intervals
whose fixing heavily depends upon some dominant intervals. In schedule
building, it is best to wait for the dominant intervals to be fixed
before making any (residual) decisions on the dominated interval.
 </p>
<p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGoal IlcSimpleCompletionGoal(IloCP
cp);</samp> returns a goal that fixes all variables of the
model. This goal should be used whenever the user-define goal terminates
with some variables remaining unfixed. Using this goal is mandatory
whenever the model contains state functions (instances of <samp class="ph codeph">IloStateFunction</samp>).</p>
