<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Custom constraints on interval sequence variables can
be written using engine extensions.</p>
<p class="p">Sequencing of non-overlaping intervals is an important
concept in scheduling applications. To model a scheduling problem,
the specific topology of a sequence of intervals or between sequences
of intervals may need to be constrained. In some cases, a complex
assembly of constraints may be used to express the constraint. For
example, the sample <samp class="ph codeph">sched_pflowshop.cpp</samp> illustrates
modeling a permutation flow shop problem. This practice has limitations
in expressivity and performance; in <samp class="ph codeph">sched_pflowshop.cpp</samp>,
a constraint per interval variable is added to the model, and these
expressions are quite complex. The model for <samp class="ph codeph">sched_pflowshop.cpp</samp> is
limited to a perfect permutation. Supporting stronger conditions or
relaxing conditions on the permutation is difficult. For example,
this model does not work if some interval variables are optional and
may be absent in the solution.</p>
<p class="p">An interval sequence variable in the engine of CP Optimizer
is an instance of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IlcIntervalSequenceVariable</samp>.
The internal data structure specialized for chronological scheduling
is the head-tail graph. The sample <samp class="ph codeph">schedsearch_permutation.cpp</samp> illustrates
writing a permutation constraint that allows some interval variables
to be absent in the solution.</p>
<p class="p">Following the design in the example, you can write your
own constraint on sequence variables. The events on the head-tail
graph include changes in presence in the sequence of an interval variable,
head and tail extensions, and the global update of the set of not
sequenced intervals. </p>
<p class="p">The filtering algorithms associated with head or tail
extensions or changes in presence of an interval in the head or tail
include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">a filtering algorithm that processes
the “last interval in head” changes that extend the
head or remove a candidate for the head; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">a filtering algorithm that processes
the “last interval in tail” changes that extend of the
tail or remove of a candidate for the tail; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">a filtering algorithm that processes
the “last interval in tail” or “last interval
in head” changes when the sequence variable is sequenced by
propagating the next relationship between the last interval in head
and the last interval in tail;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the maintenance of incremental support
on an interval in head for which the condition of the constraint is
bound before it in the head: the head boundary; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the maintenance of incremental support
on an interval in tail for which the condition of the constraint is
bound after it in the tail: the tail boundary;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">an algorithm that propagates the change
of an interval variable in head after the head boundary that considers
the neighboring in head of this interval. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">an algorithm that propagates the change
of an interval variable in tail after the tail boundary that considers
the neighboring in tail of this interval;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If possible, associated with the non
sequenced event change set, a filtering algorithm that tries to remove
candidate head and tail based on knowledge of the last present intervals
in head and tail.</p>
