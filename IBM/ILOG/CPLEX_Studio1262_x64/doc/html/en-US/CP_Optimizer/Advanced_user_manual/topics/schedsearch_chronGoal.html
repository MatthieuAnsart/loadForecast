<p class="p">In resource scheduling, the number of time points is often
quite large, generally much larger than the number of interval variables.
Any part of the problem manipulation, from modeling to solving and
displaying, should avoid enumerating the time dimension. IBM® ILOG® Concert
Technology and CP Optimizer allow a user to formally describe a scheduling
problem without time enumeration by providing classes of interval
variables and the resource description framework as sequences of functions
defined on consecutive integer intervals. For solving, the same practice
must also hold. Other than some very specific cases like proving optimality,
the predefined algorithms of CP Optimizer, such as propagation, variable
selection, decision making, search tree traversal or cost improvement
methods, enumerate only the intervals. Two samples based on classical
academic problems named the Resource Constraint Project Scheduling
Problem (RCPSP) are provided, these examples illustrate how to build
such a chronological schedule for two cases. The first example, <samp class="ph codeph">schedsearch_settimes.cpp</samp>, illustrates the case in
which all interval variables are constrained by the model to be present
in the solution. In the other example, <samp class="ph codeph">schedsearch_optionalsettimes.cpp</samp>,
there are optional interval variables in the model. The interval variables
are constrained by precedences and cumul function constraints (with
alternative of cumul for the second sample).  The samples present
several variants of Set Times Chronological Schedule building, from
the less generic and efficient to the most generic and efficient.
In particular, the second sample illustrates managing non-scheduling
decisions, specifically presence fixing, in a set times algorithm.
