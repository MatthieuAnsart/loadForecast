<title>Arguments to goals</title>
</head>
<body role="main" id="migration.uss_usradvcpoptimizergoals.1017021">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">Arguments to goals</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">arguments to goals are computed immediately, even though
goals are not executed immediately.</p>
<p class="p">Goals are not executed immediately when they are created.
However, their arguments are computed immediately, and these arguments
are saved together with the goal on the goal stack. Those arguments
and computations are used when the goal is executed. </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">For that reason, arguments should not contain pointers
to automatic objects, where automatic objects are objects allocated
on the C++ stack, that is, without using the new operator.  </p>
</div>
<p class="p">Consider the following goals:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILCGOAL1(PrintI, IlcInt*, i){
  IloCP cp = getCP();
  cp.out() &lt;&lt; *i &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  return 0;
}
ILCGOAL1(CallPrintI, IlcInt*, i){
  IlcInt i = 0;
  return PrintI(getCP(), &amp;i); // error here: i is an automatic
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">If the goal <samp class="ph codeph">CallPrintI</samp> is
executed, an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">PrintI</samp> is created.
This (among other effects) stores the address of <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>.
Then the function executing the body of <samp class="ph codeph">CallPrintI</samp> returns.
Thus the address of <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> is no longer a valid
address. Finally, the goal <samp class="ph codeph">PrintI</samp> may be
executed, causing an error since the address of <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> is
no longer valid. </p>
<p class="p">Another subtle point is that arguments are computed before
goal execution actually takes place. That fact can lead to some problems.
A simple example requires the use of a decision variable. </p>
<p class="p">Consider the following incorrect code:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILCGOAL1(WrongGoal, IlcIntVar, x){
  return IlcAnd(IlcInstantiate(x),
                PrintX(getCP(), x.getValue())); // error: x is not fixed
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The goal was intended to be executed as: the decision
variable should be fixed by the execution of the goal <samp class="ph codeph">IlcInstantiate</samp>;
then the execution of the goal <samp class="ph codeph">PrintX</samp> should
print its value. However, the argument of <samp class="ph codeph">PrintX</samp> is
computed before <samp class="ph codeph">IlcInstantiate</samp> is executed.
That order of events causes an error since <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp> is
not yet fixed. Indeed, <samp class="ph codeph">IlcInstantiate</samp> is
pushed onto the goal stack, but it is not executed immediately. </p>
<p class="p">Here is the correct way to pass <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp> as
an argument (instead of passing its value):</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILCGOAL1(PrintVar, IlcIntVar, x){
  IloCP cp = getCP();
  cp.out() &lt;&lt; x.getValue() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  return 0;
}
ILCGOAL1(RightGoal, IlcIntVar, x){
  return IlcAnd(IlcInstantiate(x),
                PrintVar(getCP(), x));   // no error here
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">As indicated in this lesson the macros <samp class="ph codeph">ILCGOALn</samp> define
subclasses of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGoalI</samp>. Arguments
to the macro are data members of the new class. The most significant
consequence of that fact is that modifications of those arguments
in the body of the macro are saved. Such modifications often have
unfortunate results, and you are strongly advised not to make such
modifications. </p>
