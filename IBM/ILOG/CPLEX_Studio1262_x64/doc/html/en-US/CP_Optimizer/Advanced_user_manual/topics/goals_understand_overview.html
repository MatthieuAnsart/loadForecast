<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Customizable search goals enable you to write your own
search strategy.</p>
<p class="p">Goals are the building blocks used to implement search
strategies in CP Optimizer, and the availability of customizable goals
enables you to write your own search strategy. Goals implement algorithms
where the exact sequence of operations to follow is not known in advance.
This kind of programming is often called non-deterministic. To help
with the task of writing a custom search, some simple strategies are
provided as pre-defined goals, such as <samp class="ph codeph">IlcInstantiate</samp>,
which works to fix one decision variable, and <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGenerate</samp>,
which works to fix an array of variables.</p>
<p class="p">When executed, a goal generally analyzes some information
based on the current domains of the decision variables and then determines
a division that would dichotomize the search space. To split the space,
the goal creates two alternatives in the search. The goal will specify
to the optimizer to try one alternative and save the other to try
if the first choice leads to a failure. Along with trying an alternative,
the goal execution generally calls another goal, perhaps itself again,
to continue dichotomizing the search space.</p>
<p class="p">Goals, as they are represented in Concert Technology,
depend on two classes: <samp class="ph codeph">IloGoal</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloGoalI</samp>.
An instance of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloGoal</samp> (a handle)
contains a data member (the handle pointer) that points to an instance
of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloGoalI</samp> (its implementation
object). Likewise, goals, as they are represented in CP Optimizer
search, depend on two classes: <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGoal</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGoalI</samp>.
An instance of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGoal</samp> (a handle)
contains a data member (the handle pointer) that points to an instance
of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGoalI</samp> (its implementation
object) which is allocated on the CP Optimizer heap. </p>
<p class="p">To define a new class of goals, you can use the macro <samp class="ph codeph">ILCGOALn</samp>.
If you want to use a new class of goals in a Concert Technology model,
you can wrap it using the macro <samp class="ph codeph">ILOCPGOALWRAPPERn</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">A goal is executed by a call to <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::solve</samp> or
an <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::startNewSearch</samp>/<samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::next</samp> pair.
A goal can either succeed or fail. A goal fails if a fail member function
(such as <samp class="ph codeph">IlcGoalI::fail</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::fail</samp>,
for example) is called during its execution. Such a call may happen
automatically when the domain of a decision variable becomes empty
through domain reduction. A goal succeeds if it does not fail. </p>
