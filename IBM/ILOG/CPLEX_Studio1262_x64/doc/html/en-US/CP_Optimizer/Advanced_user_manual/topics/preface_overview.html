<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CP Optimizer is a software library which provides
a constraint programming engine.</p>
<p class="p">The CP Optimizer feature of the IBM® ILOG® CPLEX® Optimizers is a software
library which provides a constraint programming engine targeting both
constraint satisfaction problems and optimization problems. This engine,
designed to be used in a “model &amp; run” development process, contains
powerful methods for finding feasible solutions and improving them.
The strength of the optimizer generally removes the need for you to
write and maintain a search strategy. </p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer is based on IBM ILOG Concert Technology. Concert
Technology offers a library of classes and functions that enable you
to define models for optimization problems.   Likewise, CP Optimizer
offers a library of classes and functions that enable you to find
solutions to the models. Though the CP Optimizer defaults will prove
sufficient to solve most problems, CP Optimizer offers a variety of
tuning classes and parameters to control various algorithmic choices. </p>
<p class="p">IBM ILOG Concert Technology and CP Optimizer provide
application programming interfaces (APIs) for Microsoft .NET languages, C++ and Java™. The CP Optimizer part of an
application can be completely integrated with the rest of that application
(for example, the graphical user interface, connections to databases
and so on) because it can share the same objects. </p>
<p class="p">The recommended development path for solving an optimization
problem with CP Optimizer is to use IBM ILOG Concert Technology for modeling,
together with the CP Optimizer search engine tuned with parameters
and search phases. In this way, you benefit from all future improvements
to the CP Optimizer propagation and search strategies. </p>
<p class="p">While the modeling objects provided by IBM ILOG Concert
Technology and the algorithms provided by the CP Optimizer engine
will generally be sufficient to model and solve your problem, in some
situations you may need the full flexibility of writing and maintaining
the solution process in various ways, such as writing custom constraints
and custom constructive search by means of goals. The extensions portion
of CP Optimizer is not available in all APIs.</p>
