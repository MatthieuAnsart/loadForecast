<h1 class="title topictitle1">Constraints and constraint propagation</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Engine constraints are used in the search.</p>
<p class="p">When the model is extracted to an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp>,
generally an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IlcConstraint</samp> is
automatically created for each <samp class="ph codeph">IloConstraint</samp> in
the model. </p>
<p class="p">When a constraint is added to the CP Optimizer engine
and the search is active, the constraint is used immediately to reduce
the domains of the decision variables that it involves. CP Optimizer
reduces a domain by removing those values that cannot satisfy the
constraint and thus cannot participate in a solution.</p>
<p class="p">Posting a constraint is reversible: the constraint is
removed when CP Optimizer backtracks to choice points set before that
constraint was posted. If constraint propagation causes a domain to
be reduced to a single value, then the decision variable will be bound
to that remaining value.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, when you post a constraint, the constraint
is saved so that whenever any of the variables to which it applies
is modified, the constraint will be activated, and the modification
will be transmitted to the other variables that the constraint involves.
This activity is called constraint propagation.</p>
<p class="p">The algorithm used for constraint propagation in CP Optimizer
is straightforward in principle. CP Optimizer maintains a queue of
variables, called the constraint propagation queue. When a constrained
variable is modified, that variable is put at the end of that queue
if it is not already in the queue. As long as there are variables
in that queue, the algorithm takes the first variable from the queue.
This particular variable is said to be in process.</p>
<p class="p">When a variable is processed, it is first removed from
the propagation queue. Then each constraint posted on that variable
is examined. For one such constraint, all the variables on which it
is posted are in turn examined: their domains are reduced by removing
those values that are inconsistent with it. If a variable is already
in process, then this domain reduction will be deferred until it is
no longer in process. If some of these variables are modified during
this activity, they, too, are put into the queue if they are not yet
in the queue. The algorithm continues as long as there is a variable
in the queue to process. The algorithm automatically reduces domains
as necessary and halts in either of two situations: when all domains
contain only values consistent with the constraints, or when a domain
becomes empty. For performance considerations, it does not carry out
all the reductions theoretically possible.</p>
<p class="p">This algorithm has several important properties: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">This algorithm always halts. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">It lets you use constraints (such as
arithmetic constraints, for example) on more than two variables at
a time. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">It lets you handle problems dynamically;
that is, you can solve problems where new constraints can be added
during the search for a solution. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Regardless of the order in which the
constraints are considered, the domains will always be the same at
the end of the execution of the propagation. </p>
</li>
</ul>
