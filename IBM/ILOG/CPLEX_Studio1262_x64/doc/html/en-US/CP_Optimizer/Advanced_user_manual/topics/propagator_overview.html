<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A constraint propagator is a simple way to define
a custom constraint, that is, one where you define the domain reduction
rules.</p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer offers a wide range of predefined constraints,
together with powerful logical operators for combining them. These
facilities usually suffice for expressing even the most specific model
requirements. However, when modeling and solving your problem, you
may find that it is necessary or useful to write a constraint propagator.
A constraint propagator is a simple way to define a custom constraint,
that is, one where you define the domain reduction rules via some
C++ or Java™ code.</p>
<p class="p">Some cases in which you might find it useful to write
a constraint propagator are when a predefined constraint which implements
your knowledge of the problem does not exist, when using a constraint
propagator may provide the opportunity to perform stronger inferences
(domain reductions within the propagation engine) than CP Optimizer
would typically perform, or when running time needs improvement.</p>
<p class="p">Before writing a constraint propagator in these cases,
you should attempt to model the problem using the compatibility constraints
(such as <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllowedAssignments</samp>) or to use
an alternate formulation. If these options are not practical or are
inefficient, then you may find it useful to write a constraint propagator.</p>
<p class="p">When you write a new constraint propagator to link certain
decision variables, you must implement the inference algorithm that
eliminates from the domains of those variables the values that could
not participate in a solution. These reductions are carried out by
means of <em class="ph i">elementary modifiers</em> on the domains of these
decision variables.</p>
<p class="p">This chapter explains what you must do if you decide to
implement a new constraint using constraint propagators. and contains
the following sections.</p>
