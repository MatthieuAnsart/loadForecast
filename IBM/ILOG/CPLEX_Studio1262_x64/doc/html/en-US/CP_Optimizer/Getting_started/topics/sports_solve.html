<h1 class="title topictitle1">Solve</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Once the sports scheduling problem has been described
and modeled, you use CP Optimizer classes and functions to solve the
constraint programming problem. </p>
<p class="p">Solving the problem consists of finding values for all
of the decision variables in such a way that the values simultaneously
satisfy the constraints and minimize the objective representing the
cost of the solution. To solve the problem expressed in the model,
you create an instance of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp>.</p>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.133677__migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.157893"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 19: Create an instance of IloCP</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Create
an instance of IloCP</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloCP cp(model);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The search for an optimal solution in this
problem could potentiality take a long time, so you place a <em class="ph i">time
limit</em> on the solve process. The search will stop when the time
limit is reached, even if optimality of the current best solution
is not guaranteed. You also add the code to change the display frequency
of the progress log of the search. Both of these are done by setting
parameters on the optimizer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.133677__migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.157904"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 20: Add the time limit</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Add
the time limit</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    cp.setParameter(IloCP::TimeLimit, 60);
    cp.setParameter(IloCP::LogPeriod, 10000);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Since you know information about the structure
of this problem, you can tune the optimizer to help it perform better.
While modeling the problem, you have introduced quite a few auxiliary
variables. However, the array <samp class="ph codeph">allGames</samp> contains
the solution, so it is best to assign its values first. In fact, after
all the decision variables in the array <samp class="ph codeph">allGames</samp> have
been assigned values, the values for all of the other variables in
the model will have been determined through constraint propagation.
A search strategy that chooses the variable in this array which currently
has the smallest index and assigns it a random value works well in
this problem. </p>
<p class="p">To tune the optimizer, you first indicate
that the search strategy should select from the variables of <samp class="ph codeph">allGames</samp> the variable with the smallest index that
has not been assigned a value. To do this, you pass the instance of
the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntVarEval</samp> that is returned
by the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloVarIndex</samp> to the selector <samp class="ph codeph">IloSelectSamllest</samp> and add this to a variable selector
array.</p>
<p class="p">To indicate that you want the search strategy
to try to assign a random value to the variable that has been chosen,
you pass the selector returned by the <samp class="ph codeph">IloSelectRandomValue</samp> function
to a value selector array.</p>

<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.133677__migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.157917"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 21: Create the search selectors</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Create the search selectors</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloVarSelectorArray varSel(env);
    varSel.add(IloSelectSmallest(IloVarIndex(env, allGames)));
    IloValueSelectorArray valSel(env);
    valSel.add(IloSelectRandomValue(env));
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To inform the optimizer to use these selectors,
you create an instance of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloSearchPhase</samp>,
which is the container for the information regarding tuning the search
strategy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.133677__migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.157947"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 22: Create the tuning object</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Create the tuning object</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloSearchPhase phase(env, allGames, varSel, valSel);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">As the search will likely terminate before
optimality has been proven, you use a search that allows you to examine
intermediate solutions instead of using <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::solve</samp>.
To be able to display intermediate solutions, you use three other
member functions of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp>. You
first use the member function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::startNewSearch</samp>,
whose argument is an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloSearchPhase,</samp> to
initialize the optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">To look for a solution, you
call <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::next</samp> in a loop. This tells the
optimizer to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">search for a solution in the manner defined
by the tuning object passed to <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::startNewSearch</samp> and</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">add the constraint that the following solution
must be better than the solution found previously. </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In other words, each time <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::next</samp> is
called, the new solution will yield a better value for the objective.
If no limit has been specified with a search parameter, the last solution
found is the optimal solution. </p>
<p class="p">In this lesson, you
use a loop to find better and better solutions and print the cost
for each solution found.</p>
<p class="p">After the while loop terminates,
you should use the member function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::end</samp> to
terminate the search and delete internal objects created by CP Optimizer
to carry out the search. The code for ending the optimizer is given
for you in the lesson code.</p>
