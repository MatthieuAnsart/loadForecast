<p class="p">You will learn how to model and solve a problem of scheduling
the tasks involved in building multiple houses in a manner that minimizes
the costs associated with completing each house after a given due
date and with the length of time it takes to build each house. Some
tasks must necessarily take place before other tasks, and each task
has a predefined size. Each house has an earliest starting date. Moreover,
there are two workers, each of whom must perform a given subset of
the necessary tasks, and there is a transition time associated with
a worker transferring from one house to another house. A task, once
started, cannot be interrupted. The objective is to minimize the cost,
which is composed of tardiness costs for certain tasks as well as
a cost associated with the length of time it takes to complete each
house. To find a solution to this problem using CP Optimizer, you
will use the three-stage method: describe, model and solve. </p>
