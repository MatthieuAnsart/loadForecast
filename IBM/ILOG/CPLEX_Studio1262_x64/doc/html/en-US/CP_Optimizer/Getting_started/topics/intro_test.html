<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Before proceeding with the other tutorials in
the <em class="ph i">Getting Started with CP Optimizer</em> manual, you
should test your environment by compiling and running a simple application.
The log produced by the application provides useful information about
the model and the solution search.</p>
<p class="p">This first lesson is designed to help you understand the
basic concepts in constraint programming. In future lessons, you will
work through problems by describing, modeling and solving problems
using Concert Technology and CP Optimizer classes. In this lesson,
you are provided with the completed example code so that you can test
your installation of CP Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">In <a class="xref" href="color.html" title="In this lesson, you will learn how to use CP Optimizer and a three-stage method to find a solution to a map coloring problem.">Modeling and solving a simple problem with integer variables: map coloring</a>,
you will learn about the classes and member functions used in this
program. </p>
<p class="p">The following code using the C++ API models and solves
the problem introduced in this lesson: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>#include &lt;ilcp/cp.h&gt;

    IloIntVar x(env, 5, 12, "x");
    IloIntVar y(env, 2, 17, "y");
    model.add(x + y == 17);
    model.add(x - y == 5);
    IloCP cp(model);

<p class="p">The solution found by the CP Optimizer engine is <em class="ph i">x = 11</em> and <em class="ph i">y = 6</em>. In addition to the solution, information regarding
the progress of the optimizer is displayed; this information is called
the search log, or the log. </p>
<p class="p">The first line of the log indicates the type of problem,
along with the number of decision variables and constraints in the
model. In this case, there is no objective included in the model,
so the problem is reported to be a “Satisfiability problem”. When
the model includes an objective, the problem type is reported as a
“Minimization problem” or a “Maximization problem” depending on the
type of objective. The next three lines of the log provide information
regarding the initial constraint propagation. The “Initial process
time” is the time in seconds spent at the root node of the search
tree where the initial propagation occurs. This time encompasses the
time used by the optimizer to load the model, called <em class="ph i">extraction</em>,
and the time spent in initial propagation. The value for “Log search
space” provides an estimate on the size of the depth-first search
tree; this value is the log (base 2) of the products of the domains
sizes of all the decision variables of the problem. Typically, the
estimate of the size of the search tree should be smaller after the
initial propagation, as choices will have been eliminated. However,
this value is always an overestimate of the log of the number of remaining
leaf nodes of the tree because it does not take into account the action
of propagation of constraints at each node. The memory used by the
optimizer during the initial propagation is reported. </p>
<p class="p">In order to interpret the remainder of the log file, you
may want to think about the search as a binary tree. The root of the
tree is the starting point in the search for a solution; each branch
descending from the root represents an alternative choice or decision
in the search. Each of these branches leads to a node where constraint
propagation during search will occur. If the branch does not lead
to a failure and a solution is not found at a node, the node is called
a <em class="ph i">choice point</em>. The optimizer can make an additional
decision and create two new alternative branches from the current
node, or it can jump in the tree and search from another node.</p>
<p class="p">The lines in the next section of the progress log, are
displayed periodically during the search and describe the state of
the search. The display frequency of the progress log can be controlled
with parameters of the optimizer. Since the problem in the lesson
is a simple one, only one update is displayed. </p>
<p class="p">The progress information given in a progress log update
includes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Branches: the number of branches explored
in the binary search tree;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Non-fixed: the number of uninstantiated (not
fixed) model variables;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Branch decision: the decision made at the
branch currently under consideration by the optimizer.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The final lines of the log provide information about the
entire search, after the search has terminated. This information about
the search includes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Solution status: the conditions under which
the search terminated;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Number of branches: the number of branches
explored in the binary search tree;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Number of fails: the number of branches that
did not lead to a solution;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Total memory usage: the memory used by Concert
Technology and the CP Optimizer engine;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Time spent in solve: the elapsed time from
start to the end of the search displayed in hh:mm:ss.ff format;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Search speed: average time spent per branch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In subsequent lessons in this manual, the log output is
not included in the sections which report the results. You can view
the log information when you build and run the completed programs. </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p">   The CP Optimizer search log is meant
for visual inspection only, not for mechanized parsing. In particular,
the log may change from version to version of CP Optimizer in order
to improve the quality of information displayed in the log. Any code
based on the log output may have to be updated when a new version
of CP Optimizer is released.  </p>
