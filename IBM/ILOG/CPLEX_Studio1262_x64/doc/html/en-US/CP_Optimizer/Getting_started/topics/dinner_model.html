<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Once the team building problem has been described

your development environment. This file is a program that is only
partially completed. You enter the missing code in each step in this
lesson. At the end, you will have completed the program code and you
can compile and run the program.</p>
<p class="p">In
this lesson, you include the header file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;ilcp/cp.h&gt;</samp>.
To catch exceptions that may be thrown, you use a <samp class="ph codeph">try/catch</samp> block.
The code for declaring an environment and a model, for calculating
the coaching pairs and for printing out the solution found by the
CP Optimizer engine is provided for you.</p>
<p class="p">First, you
represent the data of the program. The number of people, <samp class="ph codeph">nbPersons</samp>, is set to 60 in this example, but can
be easily modified. The number of teams, <samp class="ph codeph">nbTeams</samp>,
is 10 in this example. The size of a team, <samp class="ph codeph">teamSize</samp>,
is 6 in this example. </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>const IloInt nbPersons = 60;
const IloInt nbTeams = 10;
const IloInt teamSize = 6;
const IloInt nbServices = 6;
</code></pre>
<p class="p">As the teams and the slots in each team are
interchangeable, there is a lot of symmetry in this problem. To remove
the symmetry, you will use a two-step process to solve this problem
along with adding extra constraints. The first step is to determine
a set of integer tuples, such that each tuple represents a possible
set of new hires and existing employees to be assigned to a single
team with six slots. The second step is to select a feasible set of
ten of these tuples, one for each team, as the solution. </p>
<p class="p">The
first step requires solving a subproblem using CP Optimizer. Since
this subproblem is a constraint programming problem itself, you follow
the three step process to solve the subproblem.</p>

subproblem, you will search for all possible combinations for a single
team. There are 60 employees from six service units who can to be
assigned to a team of six people. The team must have three existing
employees and three new hires assigned to it. At most four people
from the same service unit can be on the team. If one person from
a coach/new hire pair is on the team, the other must be as well.</p>
<p class="p">The sixty people are labeled with unique identifiers in the
range 0 to 59. The existing employees are those with odd numbered
identifiers, and the new hires are those with even numbered identifiers.
The service unit memberships are the same as outlined in the description.</p>
<p class="p">Employees from Services A and B cannot be on a team together,
and employees from Services E and F cannot be on a team together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerdinner.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerdinner.135596"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Discussion</h2><p class="p">What is the known information
in this subproblem? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">There are thirty existing employees and thirty

</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">What are the decision variables or unknowns in this
problem? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The unknown is all of the possible combinations
of employees that can be assigned to one team. In other words, there
are six decision variables, one for each slot. The domain of each
of these variables is the set of employees, or [0..59].</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">What are the constraints on these variables?</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The team must have three existing employees
and three new hires.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The team cannot have just one person from
a coach/new hire pair.</p>

<li class="li"><p class="p">The team cannot have people from both Services

 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">This subproblem is modeled and solved in the function <samp class="ph codeph">MakeTeamTuples</samp>, which returns an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntTupleSet</samp>. The tupleset is the set of all feasible
solutions to the subproblem. In this function, the code for creating
the environment and model for the subproblem and for filling the data
arrays <samp class="ph codeph">newEmployee</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">service</samp>,
both indexed on the person identifiers, is provided for you. Each
element of the array <samp class="ph codeph">service</samp> states to which
service unit the associated person belongs, where the value 0 indicates
the person is an employee of Service A, the value 1 indicates the
person is in Service B, etc. The array <samp class="ph codeph">newEmployee</samp> is
a Boolean array; an element of <samp class="ph codeph">newEmployee</samp> has
the value 1 if and only if that person is a new hire.</p>
<p class="p">Each
tuple in the set to be returned has <samp class="ph codeph">teamSize</samp>,
or 6, elements. You create the <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntTupleSet</samp> using
the global environment that is the input argument to the function <samp class="ph codeph">MakeTeamTuples</samp>.</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntTupleSet ts(globalEnv, teamSize);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Each solution to the subproblem is an integer
tuple of size <samp class="ph codeph">teamSize</samp>. To represent the
subproblem unknowns, you declare an array of decision variables, <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp>, of length <samp class="ph codeph">teamSize</samp>.
The possible values for these variables are the person identifiers,
or <samp class="ph codeph">[0..nbPersons-1]</samp>.</p>

the team members variable array</samp>  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntVarArray teamMembers(env, teamSize, 0, nbPersons-1);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Next, you begin to add the subproblem constraints.
To model the constraint that there must be an equal number of new
and existing employees on a team, you use an expression <samp class="ph codeph">nbNewEmployees</samp> to
count the number of new employees assigned to the array <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp>.
You use element expressions to determine if the person assigned to
each element of <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp> is a new employee
and use the self-assigned addition operator on the expression to find
the total number of new employees assigned to <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp>.
You constrain this expression to be equal to half the number of people
on the team.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerdinner.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerdinner.152506"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 6: Add the constraint on number of new employees</h2><p class="p">Add the following

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntExpr nbNewEmployees(env); 
  for (i = 0; i &lt; teamSize; i++)
    nbNewEmployees += newEmployee[teamMembers[i]]; 
  model.add(nbNewEmployees == teamSize / 2);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To model the constraint that pairs must be
together, you constrain that each member of the pair be assigned to <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp> an equal number of times (in a later
step you will add a constraint that ensures each person is assigned
to <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp> at most once in any given
solution). You count how many times that person has been assigned
to elements of <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp> by using the IBM ILOG Concert Technology function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCount</samp>. To make sure that either both or neither
person in a pair is assigned to variables in <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp>,
you constrain that the number of times each person in the pair is
assigned to the array <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp> is equal.
Here you use the array <samp class="ph codeph">coaching</samp> which is
initialized in the main program such that the <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>-th
element has the value of -1 if the <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>-th
person does not have a coach or the identifier of the coach if the <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>-th person has a coach.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerdinner.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerdinner.152495"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 7: Add the constraint on coaching pairs</h2><p class="p">Add

      model.add(IloCount(teamMembers, i) == IloCount(teamMembers, coaching[i])); 
  }
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To add the constraints on incompatible service
units and the maximum number of people from a service unit that may
be on the same team, you need to be able to represent the service
unit of each employee. To do this, you create an array of auxiliary
constrained integer variables <samp class="ph codeph">serviceVar</samp>,
which is indexed similarly to <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp>.
(For example, the third element of <samp class="ph codeph">serviceVar</samp> represents
to which service unit the person assigned to the third element of <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp> belongs. These variables are linked
using an element expression and the <samp class="ph codeph">service</samp> data
array.</p>

</code></pre>
<p class="p">You add the constraints that at most four
people from a single service unit can be assigned to the same team
using the IBM ILOG Concert Technology
function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCount</samp> and the array <samp class="ph codeph">serviceVar</samp>.</p>

</code></pre>
<p class="p">Employees of Services A and B may not be on
the same team; likewise, employees of Services E and F may not be
on the same team. To model this, you again use the IBM ILOG Concert Technology function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCount</samp>,
but instead of constraining the expression returned, you use it to
form the subconstraints of logical constraints. These logical constraints
state that the count of employees from either Service A or Service
B who are assigned to the team must be zero, and likewise for Services
E and F.</p>

</code></pre>
<p class="p">As the elements, or slots, of the array <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp> are not ordered, the search will likely
encounter symmetry. In order to reduce symmetry, you introduce order
among the variables in the array as discussed in <a class="xref" href="sports.html" title="In this lesson, you will learn how to use CP Optimizer to find a solution to a sports scheduling problem.">Using specialized constraints and tuples: scheduling teams</a>. By introducing this order, you
also ensure that no employee will be assigned to <samp class="ph codeph">teamMembers</samp> more
than once in any solution.</p>

    model.add(teamMembers[i] &lt; teamMembers[i+1]);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">You now search for all possible solutions
to the submodel. Each solution is a valid assignment for one team.
As each solution is found, the assigned values are stored in an integer
tuple which is then added to the set of tuples that will be returned
to the main program. You create an integer tuple, or array, to temporarily
store each newly found valid team. You use an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp> to find the solutions to the problem in the
model. Since you will need to find all solutions for this subproblem
instead of one solution, you will not use <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::solve</samp>,
which terminates after a single solution has been found, in the case
that there is a solution.</p>
<p class="p">When solving a problem that
does not have an objective, the member functions <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::startNewSearch</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::next</samp> can be used in a while loop to find
all feasible solutions to a problem. The function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::startNewSearch</samp> initializes
the optimizer, the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::next</samp> searches
for a new solution in the search space. The function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::end</samp> cleans
up the internal memory and data structures used by the optimizer. </p>

have been found.</p>

<p class="p">The search terminates after all possible team
tuples have been found. In order to clean up and reclaim the memory,
you end the search and end the environment for the subproblem. You
return the created tupleset of team configurations to the main program.
Since the tupleset was created on the environment of the main program
and not for the subproblem, it will not be destroyed in the clean
up of the subproblem.</p>

<p class="p">You
represent the people assigned to the teams with a matrix of constrained
integer variables <samp class="ph codeph">group</samp>, which is indexed
on the team and slot. The array of constrained variables <samp class="ph codeph">group[i]</samp> is the group of people assigned to the <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>-th team. Each element of <samp class="ph codeph">group</samp> can
be assigned a value in the interval [<samp class="ph codeph">0..nbPersons-1</samp>].</p>
<p class="p">For each <samp class="ph codeph">group[i]</samp>, or set of people
on a team, the only possible values are those in the tupleset retuned

you flatten the matrix <samp class="ph codeph">groups</samp> into an array
of decision variables. These are not new decision variables, but merely
an alternate representation of the variables created previously. Then
by using this new array as the argument to the constraint <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</samp>, you can assure that no person will be
