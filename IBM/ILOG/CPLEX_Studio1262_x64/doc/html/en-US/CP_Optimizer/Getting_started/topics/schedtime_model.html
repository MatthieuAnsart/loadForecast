Technology classes to model it. </p>

2: Open the example file</h2><p class="p">Open the example file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/cpoptimizer/examples/tutorial/cpp/sched_time_partial.cpp</samp> in
your development environment. This file is a program that is only
partially completed. You will enter the missing code in each step
in this lesson. At the end, you will have completed the program code,
and you can compile and run the program.</p>
<p class="p">In this lesson, you
include the header file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;ilcp/cp.h&gt;</samp>. To catch
exceptions that may be thrown, you use a <samp class="ph codeph">try/catch</samp> block.
The code for creating the environment and model and for printing the
solution found by the CP Optimizer engine is provided.</p>
<p class="p">IBM ILOG Concert
Technology gives you the means to represent the unknowns in this problem,
the interval in which each task will occur, as interval variables.
   </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Interval decision variable</strong> </p>
 <p class="p">Tasks are
represented by the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntervallVar</samp> in IBM ILOG Concert
Technology.</p>
 <p class="p">An interval has a start time, an end time, a size and
a length. An interval variable allows for these values to be variable
in the model.  </p>
 <p class="p"> The length of a present interval variable
is equal to the difference between its end time and its start time.
The size is the actual amount of time the task takes to process. By
default, the size is equal to the length, which is the difference
between the end and the start of the interval. In general, the size
is a lower bound on the length.</p>
 <p class="p">An interval variable may be
optional. Whether an interval is present in the solution or not is
represented by a decision variable. If an interval is not present
in the solution, this means that any constraints on this interval act like the interval is
“not there.” Exact semantics will depend on the specific constraint. </p>
 <p class="p">Logical
relations can be expressed between the presence statuses of interval
variables, allowing, for instance, to state that whenever the interval
variable <samp class="ph codeph">a</samp> is present then the interval variable <samp class="ph codeph">b</samp> must
also be present.  </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">After you create an environment and
a model, you declare the interval variables, one for each task. Each
variable represents the unknown information, the scheduled interval
for each activity. After the problem is solved, the values assigned
to these interval variables will represent the solution to the problem.
To improve the display of the solution, it is useful to assign a name
to each of the interval variables.</p>
<p class="p">Here is the constructor for
the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntervalVar</samp> that you use in this lesson:
   </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntervalVar(const IloEnv env,
                 IloInt       sz,
                 const char*  name = 0);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The first argument that is passed to this constructor
of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntervalVar</samp> is the environment. The
second argument is the size of the task. The third argument is an
optional name that is used for debug and trace purposes. </p>

</code></pre>
<p class="p">To model the cost for starting a task earlier than
the preferred starting date, you write a function that is based on
the expression that represents the starting date of the given task.
This lesson illustrates two methods for creating this function. Concert
Technology provides the expression, <samp class="ph codeph">IloStartOf</samp>, to
represent the start time of an interval variable as an integer expression.
The single argument that is passed to the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloStartOf</samp> is
the appropriate interval variable. Here is the function:    </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntExprArg IloStartOf (const IloIntervalVar a);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To model the cost for starting a task earlier than
the preferred starting date, you use the expression <samp class="ph codeph">IloStartOf</samp> that
represents the start time of an interval variable as an integer expression. </p>
<p class="p">For
each task that has an earliest preferred start date, you determine
how many days before the preferred date it is scheduled to start using
the expression <samp class="ph codeph">IloStartOf</samp>; this expression can be
negative if the task starts after the preferred date. By taking the
maximum of this value and 0 using <samp class="ph codeph">IloMax</samp>, you determine
how many days early the task is scheduled to start. Weighting this
value with the cost per day of starting early, you determine the cost
that is associated with the task. </p>
<p class="p">Alternatively, you can represent
the earliness cost as a piecewise linear function. Concert Technology
provides the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumToNumSegmentFunction</samp> to
model a piecewise linear function.  </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Segment function</strong> </p>
 <p class="p">Piecewise
linear functions are represented by the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumToNumSegmentFunction</samp> in IBM ILOG Concert
Technology. </p>
 <p class="p"> Each interval <em class="ph i">[x1, x2)</em> on which the function
is linear is called a <em class="ph i">segment</em>. </p>
 <p class="p">When two consecutive
segments of the function are colinear, these segments are merged so
that the function is always represented with the minimal number of
segments. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">In this case, to create an instance of the <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumToNumSegmentFunction</samp>,
you use the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloPiecewiseLinear</samp>. The first argument
that is passed to the function is the environment. The second argument
is an array of points that are the endpoints of the segments. The
third argument is an array of slopes. The fourth argument is a point,
and the fifth argument is the value of the function at that point.
The sixth argument is an optional name that is used for debug and
trace purposes. Here is the function:     </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloNumToNumSegmentFunction 
                IloPiecewiseLinearFunction(const IloEnv env,
                                           const IloNumArray point,
                                           const IloNumArray slope,
                                           IloNum a,
                                           IloNum fa,
                                           const char* name = 0);

<p class="p">The piecewise linear function for the earliness function
in this problem has two segments, one from <samp class="ph codeph">-IloInfinity</samp> to
the preferred earliest start date and then one from the preferred
earliest start date to <samp class="ph codeph">IloInfinity</samp>. The cost function
on the leftmost interval is <samp class="ph codeph">-weight</samp>; on the rightmost
interval, the function value is 0. </p>
<p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">IloStartEval</samp>,
when called with an interval variable and a segment function, returns
an expression that represents the value of the function at the start
of the interval. </p>
