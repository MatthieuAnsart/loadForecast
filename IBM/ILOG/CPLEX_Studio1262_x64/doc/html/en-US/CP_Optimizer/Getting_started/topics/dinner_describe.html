<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"> The first stage in finding a solution to the team building
problem is to describe the problem using natural language. </p>
<p class="p">In this lesson, you will search for a solution to a team
configuration problem. A corporation is planning an orientation day
for new hires. During the day, the people attending the orientation,
both new hires and existing employees, need to be separated into teams.
There are 30 new hires and 30 existing employees who must be assigned
to teams. These 60 employees from six service units need to be assigned
to one of 10 teams, each of which has six slots. Each team must have
three new hires and three existing employees assigned to it. At most
four people from the same service unit can be on the same team. Twenty
of the new hires have been paired with a coach, who is an existing
employee from the same service unit as the newly hired employee. Both
people of a pair must be on the same team.</p>
<p class="p">The sixty people are labeled with unique identifiers
in the range 0 to 59. The existing employees are assigned odd values,
and the new hires are assigned even values. For the service unit memberships,
Service A is the range of people with identifiers numbered 0 to 19,
Service B is 20-39, Service C is 40-44, Service D is 45-49, Service
E is 50-54, and Service F is 55-59. The pairs are the first six pairs
from Services A and B and the first two pairs from Services C, D,
E and F. </p>
<p class="p">People from Services A and B cannot be assigned to the
same team, and people from Services E and F cannot be assigned to
the same team.</p>
<p class="p">Using the identifiers, the additional preference constraints
can be written as:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">person number 5 wants to be with person
41 or person 51,</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">person number 15 wants to be with person
40 or person 51,</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">person number 25 wants to be with person
40 or person 50, and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">person 20 is to be on the same team
as person 24, or person 22 is to be on the same team as person 50. </p>
</li>
</ul>

write a natural language description of the problem, identifying the
decision variables and the constraints on these variables. </p>
<p class="p">Write a natural language description of this problem.
Answer these questions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">What are the decision variables or unknowns
in this problem? </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">What are the constraints on these variables?</p>

<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerdinner.132234__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerdinner.125689"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Discussion</h2><p class="p">What is the known information in this problem? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">There are thirty existing employees
and thirty new hires. Each person belongs to one of six service units,
and there are twenty coach/new-hire pairs.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">There are ten teams with six slots each.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">What are the decision variables or unknowns in this problem? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The unknown is to which team each person
will be assigned. In other words, there is a decision variable for
each of the 60 slots. The domain of each of these variables is the
set of employees, or [0..59].</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">What are the constraints on these variables? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Each team must have three existing employees
and three new hires.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Coach/new hire pairs must be assigned
to the same team.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">No team can have more than four people
from a given service unit.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">No team can have people from both Services
A and B nor from both Services E and F. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">There are four constraints which describe
additional preferences.</p>
