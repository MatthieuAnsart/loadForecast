<h1 class="title topictitle1">Model</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Once the map coloring problem has been described
using natural language, you then use Concert Technology classes to
model the constraint programming problem.</p>
<p class="p">After you have written a description of your problem,
you can use IBM® ILOG® Concert Technology
classes to model it. After you create a model of your problem, you
can use CP Optimizer classes and functions to search for a solution.</p>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.145220"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 2: Open the example file</h2><p class="p">Open the
example file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/cpoptimizer/examples/tutorial/cpp/color_partial.cpp</samp> in
your development environment. This file is a program that is only
partially completed. You will enter the missing code in each step
in this lesson. At the end, you will have completed the program code,
and you can compile and run the program.</p>
<p class="p">In this lesson,
you include the header file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;ilcp/cp.h&gt;</samp>.
To catch exceptions that may be thrown, you use a <samp class="ph codeph">try/catch</samp> block.
The code for creating the array of names for the color values and
for printing out the solution found by the CP Optimizer engine is
provided.</p>
<p class="p">The first step in converting your natural
language description of the problem into code using Concert Technology
classes is to create an <em class="ph i">environment</em> and a <em class="ph i">model</em>.
 </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Environment</strong> </p>
 <p class="p">An instance of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloEnv</samp> manages
the internal modeling issues, which include handling output, memory
management for modeling objects and termination of search algorithms.</p>
 <p class="p">This instance is typically referred to as the <em class="ph i">environment</em>.
Normally an application needs only one environment, but you can create
as many environments as you want. </p>
 <p class="p">In
the C# and Java™ APIs,
the environment object is not public. To free memory used by a model
in C# API, you use the method <samp class="ph codeph">CP.End</samp>. To
free memory used by a model in the Java API, you use the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.end</samp>. </p>

<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.145228"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 3: Create the environment</h2><p class="p">Add the
following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Create the environment</samp>  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloEnv env;
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The initialization of the environment creates
internal data structures to be used in the rest of the code. After
this initialization is performed, you can create a <em class="ph i">model. </em> </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Model </strong> </p>
 <p class="p">A model
is a container for modeling objects such as decision variables, objectives
and constraints. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">The first argument passed
to the constructor of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel</samp> is
the environment. The second argument is an optional name used for
debug and trace purposes. Here is a constructor: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloModel(const IloEnv env, const char * name=0);
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.145268"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 4: Create the model</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Create
the model</samp>  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloModel model(env);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">After solving your problem, you can reclaim
memory for all modeling objects and clean up internal data structures
by calling <samp class="ph codeph">IloEnv::end</samp> for every environment
you have created. This clean-up should always be done before you exit
your application. The call to end the environment is already included
in the lesson code.</p>
<p class="p">In the Microsoft .NET Framework languages
and Java APIs, all
memory associated with the solving of the problem is reclaimed automatically
when the optimizer object is garbaged.</p>
<p class="p">IBM ILOG Concert Technology gives you the means to represent
the unknowns in this problem, the color of each country on the map,
as constrained integer, or decision, variables.  </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Decision Variable </strong> </p>
 <p class="p"> Integer
decision variables are represented by <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntVar</samp> in
the C++ and Java APIs
and by <samp class="ph codeph">IIntVar</samp> in the C# API of Concert
Technology. </p>
 <p class="p">A constrained integer variable is a decision
variable that has integers as possible values. Typically, the possible
values are represented as a domain of integers with an upper bound
and a lower bound. These variables are said to be constrained because
constraints can be placed on them. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">The first
argument passed to the constructor of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntVar</samp> is
always the environment. The second argument is the lower bound of
the domain of possible values, which defaults to 0. The third argument
is the upper bound of the domain of possible values. The upper bound
defaults to <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntMax</samp>, which represents
the largest possible positive integer on a given platform. The fourth
argument is an optional name used for debug and trace purposes. Here
is a constructor: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntVar(const IloEnv env, 
            IloInt lb = 0, 
            IloInt ub = IloIntMax
            const char* name = 0);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">After you create an environment and a model,
you declare the decision variables, one for each country. Each variable
represents the unknown information, the color of the country. The
domain of each decision variable is [0..3] or 0 to 3 inclusive. </p>
<p class="p">These values represent the possible colors:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">the value 0 represents the color blue;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the value 1 represents the color white;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the value 2 represents the color yellow;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the value 3 represents the color green. </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">After the problem is solved, the values assigned
to these decision variables will represent the solution to the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.129897"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 5: Declare the decision variables</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Declare
the decision variables</samp>  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloIntVar Belgium(env, 0, 3), Denmark(env, 0, 3), 
      France(env, 0, 3), Germany(env, 0, 3), 
      Luxembourg(env, 0, 3), Netherlands(env, 0, 3);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">IBM ILOG Concert Technology
allows you to express constraints involving decision variables using
the following operators:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">equality (<samp class="ph codeph">==</samp>),</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">less than or equal to (<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;=</samp>),</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">less than (<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;</samp>),</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">greater than or equal to (<samp class="ph codeph">&gt;=</samp>),</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">greater than (<samp class="ph codeph">&gt;</samp>)
and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">not equal to (<samp class="ph codeph">!=</samp>).</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In this example, you use a constraint to require
that if two countries are neighbors, they cannot be the same color.
For example, the statement <samp class="ph codeph">Belgium != France</samp> indicates
that the neighbors France and Belgium should not share the same color.
Explicitly, it means that the value the CP Optimizer engine assigns
to the decision variable <samp class="ph codeph">Belgium</samp> cannot
equal the value the optimizer assigns to the variable <samp class="ph codeph">France</samp>.
    </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Constraint </strong> </p>
 <p class="p">Constraints specify the restrictions on the values that may
be assigned to decision variables. To create a constraint for a model,
you can: </p>
 <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">use an arithmetic operator between decision
variables and expressions to return a constraint,</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">use a function that returns a constraint,</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">use a specialized constraint or</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">use a logical operator between constraints
which returns a constraint.</p>
</li>
</ul>
 <p class="p">Expressions, logical constraints and specialized
constraints will all be introduced in later lessons.</p>
 <p class="p">After
you create a constraint, you must explicitly add it to the model in
order for it to be taken into account by the CP Optimizer engine. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">You use the member function <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel::add</samp> to
add constraints to the model. You must explicitly add a constraint
to the model object or the CP Optimizer engine will not use it in
the search for a solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.129914"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 6: Add the constraints</h2><p class="p">Add the following
code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Add the constraints</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    model.add(Belgium != France); 
    model.add(Belgium != Germany); 
    model.add(Belgium != Netherlands);
