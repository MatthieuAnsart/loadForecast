<h1 class="title topictitle1">Model</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Once the house building with state incompatibilities
problem has been described using natural language, you then use Concert
Technology classes to model the constraint programming problem.</p>
<p class="p">After you have written a description of your problem,
you can use IBM® ILOG® Concert Technology
classes to model it. </p>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerschedstate.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerschedstate.159941"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 2: Open the example file</h2><p class="p">Open the
example file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/cpoptimizer/examples/tutorial/cpp/sched_state_partial.cpp</samp> in
your development environment. This file is a program that is only
partially completed. You will enter the missing code in each step
in this lesson. At the end, you will have completed the program code,
and you can compile and run the program.</p>
<p class="p">In
this lesson, you include the header file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;ilcp/cp.h&gt;</samp>.
To catch exceptions that may be thrown, you use a <samp class="ph codeph">try/catch</samp> block.
The code for creating the environment and model and for printing out
the solution found by the CP Optimizer engine is provided.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, the data related to the tasks, such as the tasks
(<samp class="ph codeph">Tasks</samp>), the number of tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">NbTasks</samp>),
the names of the tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">TaskNames</samp>) and sizes
of the tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">TaskDurations</samp>) and constants
representing the number of houses (<samp class="ph codeph">NbHouses</samp>),
the number of workers (<samp class="ph codeph">NbWorkers</samp>) and the
two cleanliness states (<samp class="ph codeph">Clean</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">Dirty</samp>) are provided.</p>
<p class="p">After you create
an environment and a model, you need to define the decision variables
and add the constraints and objective to the model. Since the requirements
for each of the five houses are similar, you use a function <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp>. to create the decision variables, constraints
and objective associated with each house. Information about individual
houses that must be shared with the main function includes the expressions
needed to create the objective function and information about worker
usage. In order to display the results of the optimization, it is
also useful to maintain an array of all the interval variables. </p>
<p class="p">To access this information, you create objects that will
be updated in the <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp> function. The
cost expression involves the date at which moving is completed for
each house; the integer expression array <samp class="ph codeph">ends</samp> is
used to store this information. An array of task interval variables, <samp class="ph codeph">allTasks</samp>, stores all the interval variables that
are created. In addition, the expression used to represent worker
usage is included in the global information that is updated in each
call to the <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp> function.</p>
<p class="p">Since
the workers are equivalent in this problem, it is better to represent
them as one pool of workers instead of as individual workers with
no overlap constraints as was done in the earlier examples. This representation
removes symmetry. The cumulative function expression representing
usage of the pool of workers can be modified by the interval variables
that require a worker. </p>

<p class="p">The transition time from a dirty state to

<p class="p">Certain tasks require the house to be clean,
and other tasks cause the house to be dirty. To model the possible
states of the house, Concert Technology provides the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloStateFunction</samp> to represent the disjoint states
through time.    </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">State
function</strong> </p>
 <p class="p">A state function, represented in IBM ILOG Concert Technology by <samp class="ph codeph">IloStateFunction</samp>, is a decision variable whose value
is a set of non-overlapping intervals over which the function maintains
a particular non-negative integer state. In between those intervals,
the state of the function is not defined, typically because of an
ongoing transition between two states. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">You
create one state function object in each execution of <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp>,
one for each house. </p>
<p class="p">The first argument passed to the
constructor of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloStateFunction</samp> is
the environment. The second argument is the transition time object.
The final argument is an optional name used for debug and trace purposes.
Here is a constructor:    </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloStateFunction(const IloEnv env,

                   const char* name =0);

<p class="p">To model the state required or imposed by
a task, you create a constraint that specifies the state of the house
throughout the interval variable representing that task.    </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Constraint on cumul function expression</strong> </p>
 <p class="p">With the specialized constraint <samp class="ph codeph">IloAlwaysEqual</samp>,
you can create a constraint that specifies the value of a state function
over the interval variable.    </p>
 <p class="p">The constraint takes
a state function, an interval variable and a state value. Whenever
the interval variable is present, then the state function is defined
everywhere between the start and the end of the interval variable
and remains equal to the specified state value over this interval. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">The first argument passed to the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloAlwaysEqual</samp> is
the environment. The second argument is the state function. The third
argument is the interval variable on which you want to place the constraint.
The fourth argument is the state value that the state function must
take during the interval.</p>

<p class="p">To model the cost of building the houses,
you will need to determine the maximum completion date among the individual
house projects. To access the expression representing the completion
date of the house currently in consideration, you use the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloEndOf</samp> on the last task in building a house (here,
it is the moving task) and store this expression in the array <samp class="ph codeph">ends</samp>.   </p>
