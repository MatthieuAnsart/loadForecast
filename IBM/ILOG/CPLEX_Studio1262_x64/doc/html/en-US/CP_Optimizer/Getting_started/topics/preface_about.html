<h1 class="title topictitle1">About this manual</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The <em class="ph i">Getting Started with CP Optimizer</em> manual
is composed of lessons which are designed to guide you in learning
about the concepts and features of CP Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">This is the <em class="ph i">Getting Started with CP Optimizer</em> manual.
It is composed of lessons that use a procedural-based learning strategy.
Each procedural-based lesson is built around a sample problem, and
you work on a partially completed code example. As you follow the
steps in the lesson, you complete the code and learn about the concepts.
Then, you compile and run the code and analyze the results. At the
end of each lesson, there are review exercises. </p>
<p class="p">This manual is designed to be used by programmers who
may or may not have any knowledge of constraint programming. The ideal
usage context for this manual is sitting in front of your computer,
with IBM® ILOG® Concert Technology and CP Optimizer installed.
You work through the lessons and exercises. </p>
<p class="p">If you are a novice CP Optimizer user, start at the beginning
of this manual, since the lessons build on each other.</p>
