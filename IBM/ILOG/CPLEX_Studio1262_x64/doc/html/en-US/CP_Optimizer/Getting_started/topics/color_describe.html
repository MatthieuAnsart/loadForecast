<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The first stage in finding a solution to the map coloring
problem is to describe the problem using natural language.</p>
<p class="p">The problem involves choosing colors for the countries
on a map in such a way that at most four colors (blue, white, yellow,
green) are used, and no pair of neighboring countries are the same
color. In this lesson, you will find a solution for a map coloring
problem with six countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg
and the Netherlands. Map coloring problems are closely related to
graph coloring problems and have many real world applications. </p>

write a natural language description of the problem, identifying the
decision variables and the constraints on these variables. </p>
<p class="p">Write a natural language description of this problem. </p>
<p class="p">Answer these questions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">What is the known information in this
problem?</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">What are the decision variables or unknowns
in this problem? </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">What are the constraints on these variables?
 </p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Decision variables and constraints </strong> </p>

<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Decision variables</em> are
the unknown information in a problem. Each decision variable has a <em class="ph i">domain</em> of possible <em class="ph i">values</em>.  </p>

<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Constraints</em> are
limits or restrictions on combinations of values for decision variables.
 </p>

<p class="p">For more information on decision variables and constraints,
see the section <a class="xref" href="intro__model.html" title="The second stage in solving a constraint programming problem with CP Optimizer is to model the problem. The model is composed of decision variables and constraints. The model may also contain an objective.">Model the problem</a>.<samp class="ph codeph"> </samp> </p>

<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizercolor.119397__umvhrA7F"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Discussion</h2><p class="p">What is the known information in this problem? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">There are six known countries on a map. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">There are four known colors. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">What are the decision variables or unknowns in this problem? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The unknown is the connection between
the country and the color: what color is each country? In other words,
there are six variables; each variable represents the color of a specific
country on the map. Each decision variable has a domain of four possible
values: blue, white, yellow and green. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">What are the constraints on these variables? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">In this case, each constraint specifies
that a country cannot be assigned the same color as any of its neighbors.
In other words, if the value of the decision variable representing
the color of Belgium is blue, then the value of the variable representing
the color of Germany cannot also be blue, since they are neighboring
countries.</p>
