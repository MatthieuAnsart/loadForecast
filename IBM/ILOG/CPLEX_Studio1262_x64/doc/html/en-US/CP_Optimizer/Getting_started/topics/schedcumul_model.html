<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Once the house building with budget and resource pools

<p class="p">After you have written a description of your problem, you can use IBM® ILOG® Concert

<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerschedcumul.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerschedcumul.158085"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step
2: Open the example file</h2><p class="p">Open
the example file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/cpoptimizer/examples/tutorial/cpp/sched_cumul_partial.cpp</samp> in
your development environment. This file is a program that is only
partially completed. You will enter the missing code in each step
in this lesson. At the end, you will have completed the program code,
and you can compile and run the program.</p>
<p class="p">In this lesson, you
include the header file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;ilcp/cp.h&gt;</samp>. To catch
exceptions that may be thrown, you use a <samp class="ph codeph">try/catch</samp> block.
The code for creating the environment and model and for printing out
the solution found by the CP Optimizer engine is provided.</p>
<p class="p">In
addition, the data related to the tasks, such as the tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">Tasks</samp>),
the number of tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">NbTasks</samp>), the names of the tasks
(<samp class="ph codeph">TaskNames</samp>) and sizes of the tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">TaskDurations</samp>),
are provided. The number of workers (<samp class="ph codeph">NbWorkers</samp>) is
also provided.</p>
<p class="p">After you create an environment and a model,
you need to define the decision variables and add the constraints
and objective to the model. Since the requirements for each of the
five houses are similar, you use a function, <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp>,
to create the decision variables, constraints and costs associated
with each house. Information about individual houses that must be
shared with the main function includes the expressions needed to create
the objective function and information about worker usage and the
cash balance. In order to display the results of the optimization,
it is also useful to maintain an array of all the interval variables. </p>
<p class="p">To
access this information, you create objects to be updated in the <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp> function.
An array of task interval variables, <samp class="ph codeph">allTasks</samp>, stores
all the interval variables that are created.   The cost expression
involves the date at which moving is completed for each house, and
the integer expression array <samp class="ph codeph">ends</samp> is used to store
this information. In addition, the expressions used to represent worker
usage and the cash balance are included in the global information
that is updated in each call to the <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp> function.</p>
<p class="p">Since
the workers are equivalent in this problem, it is better to represent
them as one pool of workers instead of as individual workers with
no overlap constraints as was done in the earlier examples. This representation
removes symmetry. The expression representing usage of the pool of
workers can be modified by the interval variables that require a worker. </p>
<p class="p">To
model both the limited number of workers and the limited budget, you
need to represent the sum of individual contributions of interval
variables. In the case of the cash budget, some tasks consume some
of the budget at the start. In the case of the workers, a task requires
a worker only for the duration of the task. Concert Technology provides
the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCumulFunctionExpr</samp> to represent the sum
of individual contributions of interval variables.      </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cumulative
function expression</strong> </p>
 <p class="p">A cumulative function, represented
in IBM ILOG Concert Technology by <samp class="ph codeph">IloCumulFunctionExpr</samp>,
can be used to model a resource usage function over time. This function
can be computed as a sum of interval variable demands on a resource
over time. </p>
 <p class="p">An interval usually increases the cumulated resource
usage function at its start time and decreases it when it releases
the resource at its end time (pulse function).</p>
 <p class="p">For resources
that can be produced and consumed by activities (for instance the
contents of an inventory or a tank), the resource level can also be
described as a function of time. A production activity will increase
the resource level at the start or end time of the activity whereas
a consuming activity will decrease it. The cumulated contribution
of activities on the resource can be represented by a function of
time, and constraints can be posted on this function (for instance,
a maximal or a safety level). </p>
 <p class="p">A cumulative function expression
can be computed as a sum of the following types of elementary demands: </p>
 <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">IloStep</samp>, which increases or decreases the
level of the function by a given amount at a given time;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">IloPulse</samp>, which increases or decreases the
level of the function by a given amount for the length of a given
interval variable or fixed interval;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">IloStepAtStart</samp>, which increases or decreases
the level of the function by a given amount at the start of a given
interval variable;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">IloStepAtEnd</samp>, which increases or decreases
the level of the function by a given amount at the end of a given
interval variable.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
 <p class="p">A cumulative function expression can be constrained to model
limited resource capacity by constraining that the function be <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;=</samp> the
capacity. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">To illustrate, consider a cumulative resource
usage function that measures how much of a resource is being used.
There are two intervals, A and B, bound in time, and each interval
increases the cumulative function expression by one unit over its
duration. For each interval, this modification to the cumulative resource
usage function can be made by incrementing the cumulative function
with the elementary function <samp class="ph codeph">IloPulse</samp>, created with
the interval and the given amount. Given this, the function would
take the profile as in the figure “Pulse on Cumulative Function Expression.”</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Pulse on Cumulative Function Expression</span><div class="image"><img class="image" src="../images/pulse_cdr.png" alt="Graph of a pulse function" /></div></div>
<p class="p">As another example, consider a function measuring a consumable
resource, similar to the budget resource. Consider that the level
of the resource is zero, until time 2 when the value is increased
to 4; modeled by modifying the cumulative function with the elementary
cumul function <samp class="ph codeph">IloStep</samp> at time 2. There are two intervals,
A and B, fixed in time. Interval A decreases the level of the resource
by 3 at the start of the interval, modeled by applying <samp class="ph codeph">IloStepAtStart</samp>,
created with Interval A and the value (3), to the cumulative function.
Interval B increases the level of the resource by 2 at the end of
the interval, modeled by applying <samp class="ph codeph">IloStepAtEnd</samp>, created
with Interval B and the value (2), to the cumulative function for
the interval. Given this, the function would take the profile as in
the figure “Step on Cumulative Function Expression.”</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 2. Step
on Cumulative Function Expression</span><div class="image"><img class="image" src="../images/step_cdr.png" alt="Graph of a consumable resource over time" /></div></div>
<p class="p">For the house building problem, you create two cumulative
function expression objects, one to represent the usage of the workers
and the other to represent the cash balance. The constructor of the
class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCumulFunctionExpr</samp> takes one argument, the
environment.</p>

<p class="p">To set the increases to the cash balance, you use the
function <samp class="ph codeph">IloStep</samp>, which can be used to increment
or decrement the cumulative function expression by a fixed amount
on a given date. The first argument passed to this function is the
environment. The second argument is the date at which the function

array <samp class="ph codeph">tasks</samp> of interval variables. As you create
each interval variable, you also add it to the array <samp class="ph codeph">allTasks</samp> that
will be used to display the solution once the schedule has been computed. </p>
<p class="p">Each
task also requires one worker from the start to the end of the task
interval. To represent the fact that a worker is required for the

<p class="p">To model the cost of building the houses, you will
need to determine the maximum completion date among the individual
house projects. To determine the expression representing the completion
