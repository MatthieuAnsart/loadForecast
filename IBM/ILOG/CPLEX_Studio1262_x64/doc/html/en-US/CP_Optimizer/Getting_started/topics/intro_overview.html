<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The first tutorial in the <em class="ph i">Getting
Started with CP Optimizer</em> manual explains the basics of describing,
modeling and solving constraint programming problems. </p>
<p class="p">In this lesson, you will learn how to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">use the three-stage method to describe, model
and solve problems;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">identify decision variables and constraints;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">understand basic constraint propagation and
search;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">understand the basic building blocks of a
scheduling model;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">compile a sample program to ensure your installation
is working correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The CP Optimizer feature of the IBM® ILOG® CPLEX® Optimizers is a software
library which provides a constraint programming engine targeting both
constraint satisfaction problems and optimization problems. CP Optimizer
provides a library of re-usable and maintainable classes that can
be used just as they are, or extended to meet special needs. Those
classes define objects in the problem domain in a natural and intuitive
way so that you can cleanly distinguish the problem representation
from the problem resolution. </p>
<p class="p">One of the main advantages of constraint programming is
that it enables you to represent your problem explicitly in a natural
and intuitive model, so that your problem representation serves simultaneously
as a declarative specification. This congruence between the problem
specification and the problem representation guarantees that the resolution
of the constraints does, indeed, solve the problem as defined. In
other words, there is no “slip” between the model of the problem and
the implementation of its solution. CP Optimizer embodies this advantage
of modeling and solving in a ready-to-use library of tools. </p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer offers features specially adapted to solving
problems in scheduling with continuous time and resource allocation.
There are, for example, classes of objects particularly designed to
represent such aspects as tasks and temporal constraints. CP Optimizer
offers you a workbench of modeling features that intuitively and naturally
tackle the issues inherent in scheduling and allocation problems. </p>
