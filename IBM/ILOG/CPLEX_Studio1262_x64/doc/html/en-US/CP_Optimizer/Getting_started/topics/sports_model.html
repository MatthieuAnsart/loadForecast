2: Open the example file</h2><p class="p">Open the example file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/cpoptimizer/examples/tutorial/cpp/sports_partial.cpp</samp> in
your development environment. </p>
<p class="p">In this lesson, you include the
header file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;ilcp/cp.h&gt;</samp>. To catch exceptions
that may be thrown, you use a <samp class="ph codeph">try/catch</samp> block. The
code for declaring an environment and a model, calculating the unique
game identifiers and for printing out the solution found by the CP
Optimizer engine is provided for you.</p>
<p class="p">First, you represent the
data of the program. The number of teams, <samp class="ph codeph">n</samp>, is set
to a default of 10 in this example, but can be changed with an input
argument. (For this problem, the number of teams must always be even.
If the number of teams is not even, it is increased by 1.) The code
for processing the input argument is provided for you: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloInt n = 10;
    if (argc &gt; 1)

<p class="p">The number of weeks, <samp class="ph codeph">nbWeeks</samp>, is <samp class="ph codeph">2*(n-1)</samp>,
or 18 in this example. The number of game slots per week, <samp class="ph codeph">nbGamesPerWeek</samp>,
is <samp class="ph codeph">nbTeams/2</samp>, or 5 in this example. The number of
game slots, <samp class="ph codeph">nbGames</samp>, is equal to the number of weeks
times the number of game slots per week, or 90 in this example. The
number of games to be scheduled is equal to the number of game slots
available.</p>

</code></pre>
<p class="p">Each week has five slots; each slot must have a game
assigned to it. The unknowns in this problem are which game is assigned
to which slot. To represent these unknowns, you declare a matrix of
decision variables, <samp class="ph codeph">games</samp>, which is indexed on week
and slot.   To create the matrix of variables, you create an array
in which each element is an array of constrained integer variables.
The domain of values for each variable in <samp class="ph codeph">games</samp> is
the set of unique game identifiers; in this example the domain of
each variable is [0..89]. The matrix of variables <samp class="ph codeph">games</samp> will
represent the solution to the problem after a solution has been found
by the CP Optimizer engine.</p>
<p class="p">To help you model the constraints
that involve the home and away teams, it will be useful to be able
to easily determine which team is the home team and which team is
the away team for each slot. You declare auxiliary variables that
are not directly a part of the solution, but make it easier to model
the breaks and other constraints. You declare matrices of decision
variables which represent the teams that will play at home and away
in each slot, called <samp class="ph codeph">home</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">away</samp>,
respectively. These matrices are indexed on week and slot in the same
manner as the matrix <samp class="ph codeph">games</samp>. The domain of the variables
in each of these matrices are the teams, represented by integers in
the range [0..9].</p>

<p class="p">For each slot, you need to link the variables in the
arrays <samp class="ph codeph">game</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">home</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">away</samp>.
In other words, you constrain that only certain configurations of
home team, away team and game identifiers are allowed. These allowed
configurations can be modeled as a set of integer tuples.  </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Set

 <p class="p">An <em class="ph i">integer tuple</em> is an ordered set of

an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IIntTupleSet</samp> in the C# API. </p>
 <p class="p">The

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntTupleSet(IloEnv env, const int arity);

<p class="p">You use the member function <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntTupleSet::add</samp> to

<p class="p">In this example, the game identifier
indicates a particular pairing of home team and away team. Using the <samp class="ph codeph">Game</samp> function,
you see that the game in which Team 1 plays at home against Team 2
is Game 10. This combination is a tuple. You would write it as (1,
2, 10). The number of values in a tuple is known as the arity of the
tuple. The tuple (1, 2, 10) has an arity of 3. You calculate all allowed

<p class="p">The complete set of possible combinations of home team,
away team and game identifier are enumerated in the set of tuples, <samp class="ph codeph">gha</samp>.
To constrain the values assigned to a given slot of the matrices of <samp class="ph codeph">home</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">away</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">games</samp> variables
to be allowed combinations, you use the IBM ILOG Concert Technology constraint <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllowedAssignments</samp>.
 </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Compatibility constraint </strong> </p>
 <p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllowedAssignments</samp> takes
an array of decision variables and a set of tuples. It returns a constraint
that specifies that the only possible combinations of allowed values

 </div>
<p class="p">The
function <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllowedAssignments</samp> returns an instance
of an <samp class="ph codeph">IloConstraint</samp>. The first argument passed to

the allowed combinations of values for the array of variables. The
arity of the tuples must be the same as the length of the array of
the decision variables. Here is the function signature you will use:

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloConstraint IloAllowedAssignments(const IloEnv env,

<p class="p">For each slot, you build a small temporary array of
decision variables from variables you have already created. This new
array has the <samp class="ph codeph">home</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">away</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">games</samp> variables
associated with the given slot. Note that you are not creating new
decision variables but creating an alternate manner of referencing
the previously created variables. Adding the compatibility constraint
that the allowed assignments for these variables must be in the set
of tuples, <samp class="ph codeph">gha</samp>, ensures that these three matrices
of variables are properly linked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.131017__migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.157741"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step

        vars.add(games[i][j]);
        model.add(IloAllowedAssignments(env, vars, gha));
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Now that the auxiliary variables are properly linked
to the <samp class="ph codeph">games</samp> variables, you begin to model the constraints
as outlined in the description of the problem. The first set of constraints
state that each team can play in exactly one slot a week. For each
week, no team can appear twice in the set of variables representing
the teams playing at home and away for that week. In other words,
the home and away variables associated with a given week must all
be assigned different values in any solution. For each week, you create
an array with all of the home and away variables for that week. To
state that the value assigned to each decision variable in an array
must be different from that of every other variable in that array,
you use the IBM ILOG Concert Technology predefined constraint <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</samp>.
   </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">All different constraint </strong> </p>
 <p class="p">Using specialized

 <p class="p">The single constraint <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</samp> on <samp class="ph codeph">n</samp> variables
is logically equivalent to <samp class="ph codeph">n(n-1)/2</samp> instances of
the “not equal” constraint, <samp class="ph codeph">!=</samp>, between each pair
of decision variables in the array.  </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">The class <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</samp> is
a subclass of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloConstraint</samp>. The constructor
of <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</samp> takes the environment as its first
argument. The second argument is the array of variables. The third
argument is an optional name used for debug and trace purposes. Here
is the function signature you will use:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloAllDiff(const IloEnv env, 
             const IloIntVarArray vars = 0, 
             const char* name = 0);
 </code></pre>
<p class="p">To simplify creating the single array containing the
home and away variables for a given week, you use the <samp class="ph codeph">add</samp> method
of <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntVarArray</samp> whose single argument is an <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntVarArray</samp>.
This method appends the argument array to the invoking array.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.131017__migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.157754"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step
7: Add the alldiff constraint</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after

      teamsThisWeek.add(away[i]);
      model.add(IloAllDiff(env, teamsThisWeek));
    }
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Next, you add the constraints that the two games between
a pair of teams must be in different halves of the season and also
must be at least six weeks apart (if there are fewer than 6 teams,
this minimum distance is reduced). To simplify modeling this constraint,
you create auxiliary variables to represent the week of the season
in which each game will be played.</p>
<p class="p">You create the array <samp class="ph codeph">weekOfGame</samp> which
is indexed on game identifiers. Each element of this array is a decision
variable with a domain of the possible weeks, [0..17]. The value of
each variable in this array represents the week in which that game
will be played. </p>
<p class="p">To ensure that the <samp class="ph codeph">weekOfGame</samp> variables
are assigned the appropriate values, you need to be able to determine
the week of each game. Assuming that each game is played exactly once,
the week that game <samp class="ph codeph">g</samp> is played is <samp class="ph codeph">w</samp>,
where there is an <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> such that <samp class="ph codeph">game[w][i]</samp> is
assigned the value <samp class="ph codeph">g</samp>. To model this relationship,
you use two steps. First, you determine which slot a game has been
assigned to, then you determine the week of that slot.</p>
<p class="p">To determine
to which slot a game has been assigned, you create two arrays of decision
variables, each of length <samp class="ph codeph">nbGames</samp>. One is a “flattened”
version of the matrix <samp class="ph codeph">games</samp>, called <samp class="ph codeph">allGames</samp>.
The variables in <samp class="ph codeph">allGames</samp> are not new variables,
but provide an alternate view on the original variables in <samp class="ph codeph">games</samp>.
The other array,<samp class="ph codeph"> allSlots</samp>, is indexed by the games.
The domain of each variable in <samp class="ph codeph">allSlots</samp> is the set
of values of the indices of <samp class="ph codeph">allGames</samp>, [0..89]. Since <samp class="ph codeph">allSlots[i]
== j</samp> if and only if <samp class="ph codeph">allGames[j] == i</samp>, the
arrays have an inverse relationship. This relationship can be modeled
using the IBM ILOG Concert Technology constraint <samp class="ph codeph">IloInverse</samp>.

<p class="p">The class <samp class="ph codeph">IloInverse</samp> is a subclass

array of decision variables. The third argument is the other array

<p class="p">As the arrays are of the same length, this constraint
also has the virtue of ensuring that in any solution, the values assigned

one game is scheduled in the last half of the season, then the other
game must be scheduled in the first half of the season and that if
one game is not scheduled in the last half of the season, then the

<p class="p">You next write the constraint on the maximum size of
breaks. No team can have a break of length three or greater. In other
words, in any sequence of three weeks, a team must play at least one
game at home and no more than two games at home. In order to count
the number of games at home in a sequence of three weeks, you create
a matrix of auxiliary variables indexed on team and week called <samp class="ph codeph">playHome</samp>.
The domain of each variable in this matrix is [0..1]. A value of 0
indicates the team plays away that week and a value of 1 indicates
that the team plays at home that week.</p>
<p class="p">To constrain each variable
in <samp class="ph codeph">playHome</samp> to be assigned the appropriate value,
you use the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCount</samp>. You constrain the
value of the element of <samp class="ph codeph">playHome</samp> for that week and
team by counting the number of times that a particular team plays
at home during a particular week (it must be 0 or 1).</p>
<p class="p">For each
team, you represent each sequence of three games with a subarray of
the array <samp class="ph codeph">playHome</samp>. Using this subarray and the predefined IBM ILOG Concert
Technology function <samp class="ph codeph">IloSum</samp>, you can represent the
number of time the team plays at home during the three weeks.     </p>

you count the number of breaks, which is now easily represented as
two consecutive weeks for which the <samp class="ph codeph">playHome</samp> variables

using a self-assigned addition operator. The variable <samp class="ph codeph">breaks</samp> is

<p class="p">While the model has now been fully expressed, there
are additional constraints that can be introduced to help improve
the search. The first set of additional constraints are called <em class="ph i">surrogate
constraints</em>. The second type of additional constraints are constraints
used to <em class="ph i">reduce symmetry</em>.      </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Surrogate constraint </strong> </p>
 <p class="p">A <em class="ph i">surrogate
constraint</em> makes explicit a property that satisfies a solution
implicitly. In fact, in some disciplines, surrogate constraints are
known as implicit constraints for that reason. Such a constraint should
not change the nature of the solution, but its propagation should
delimit the general shape of the solution more quickly. </p>
 <p class="p"> In
any case where an implicit property makes good sense, or derives from
experience, or satisfies formal computations, its explicit implementation
as a surrogate constraint can be beneficial. </p>
 <p class="p"> Since constraint
propagation decreases the search space by reducing the domains of
variables, it is obviously important to express all necessary constraints.
In some cases, it is even a good idea to introduce surrogate constraints
to reduce the size of the search space by supplementary propagation.
 </p>
 <p class="p">Processing supplementary constraints inevitably slows down
execution. However, this slowing down may be negligible in certain
problems when it is compared with the efficiency gained from reducing
the size of the search space. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p"> It is known that a team
must play half of its games at home. This is already implicitly expressed
in the model within the set of tuples, so you are certain every solution
will satisfy this. However, adding an additional constraint on the <samp class="ph codeph">playHome</samp> variables
will improve the constraint propagation.</p>

apparent complexity of a problem can often be reduced to a much smaller
