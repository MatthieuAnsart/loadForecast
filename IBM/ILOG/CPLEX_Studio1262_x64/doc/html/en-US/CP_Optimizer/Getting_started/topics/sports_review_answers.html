<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.131569__migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.131572"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Suggested answer</h2><p class="p">An tuple is an ordered set of values. For example, if
you state that Team 1 must play Team 2 in Game 7, this is a tuple.
You would write it as (1, 2, 7). In the C++ API, the tuple would be
represented by the array of values  <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntArray(env,3,1,2,7)</samp>.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.131569__migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.131576"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Suggested answer</h2><p class="p">Two types of constraints that can be added to improve
constraint propagation and the search are surrogate constraints and
constraints that reduce symmetry. Surrogate constraints are additional
constraints that are valid for the model, but have not been explicitly
expressed in the modeling constraints. Constraints that reduce symmetry
eliminate extra solutions that can be considered as permutations of
other solutions.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.131569__migration.uss_gscpoptimizersports.131580"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Suggested answer</h2><p class="p">A logical constraint is created by combining constraints
or placing constraints on other constraints. Logical constraints are
based on the idea that constraints have value. CP Optimizer handles
constraints not only as if they have a Boolean value, such as true
or false, but effectively as if the value is 0 or 1. This allows you
to combine constraints into expressions or impose constraints on constraints</p>
