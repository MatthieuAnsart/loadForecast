<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Once the house building with workers problem has

example file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/cpoptimizer/examples/tutorial/cpp/sched_sequence_partial.cpp</samp> in
your development environment. This file is a program that is only
partially completed. You will enter the missing code in each step
in this lesson. At the end, you will have completed the program code,
and you can compile and run the program.</p>
<p class="p">In
this lesson, you include the header file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;ilcp/cp.h&gt;</samp>.
To catch exceptions that may be thrown, you use a <samp class="ph codeph">try/catch</samp> block.
The code for creating the environment and model and for printing out
the solution found by the CP Optimizer engine is provided.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, the data related to the tasks, such as the tasks
(<samp class="ph codeph">Tasks</samp>), the number of tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">NbTasks</samp>),
the names of the tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">TaskNames</samp>) and sizes
of the tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">TaskDurations</samp>), are provided.</p>
<p class="p">After you create an environment and a model, you need to
define the decision variables and add the constraints and objective
to the model. Since the requirements for each of the five houses are
similar, you use a function, <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp>,
to create the decision variables, constraints and costs associated
with a house. The information about individual houses that must be
shared with the main function includes the cost expression and the
set of tasks associated with each worker. This set of tasks is needed
in order to create the constraints for each worker that involve tasks
of different houses. In order to display the results of the optimization,
it is also useful to maintain an array of all the interval variables. </p>
<p class="p">To access this global information, you create objects to
be updated in the <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp> function. An
array of task interval variables, <samp class="ph codeph">allTasks</samp>,
stores all the interval variables that are created. The overall cost
is represented by a numerical expression called <samp class="ph codeph">cost</samp>.
For the worker Joe, you create two arrays to be filled by the <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp> function: <samp class="ph codeph">joeTasks</samp>,
an array of interval variables, and <samp class="ph codeph">joeLocations</samp>,
an array of integers. These two corresponding arrays are indexed the
same, so that for each index <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">joeTasks[i]</samp> is performed at <samp class="ph codeph">joeLocation[i]</samp>.
A similar pair of arrays are created for the worker Jim. These four
arrays are passed to the <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp> function
which adds elements to these arrays as the interval variables and
constraints are created</p>
