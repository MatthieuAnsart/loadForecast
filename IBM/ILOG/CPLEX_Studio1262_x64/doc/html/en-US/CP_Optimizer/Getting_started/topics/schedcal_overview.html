<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">use the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumToNumStepFunction</samp>;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">use an alternative constructor of the

</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">use intensity expressions;</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">You will learn how to model and solve a house building
problem, a problem of scheduling the tasks involved in building multiple
houses in such a manner that minimizes the overall completion date
of the houses. Some tasks must necessarily take place before other
tasks, and each task has a predefined size. Moreover, there are two
workers, each of whom must perform a given subset of the necessary
tasks. Each worker has a calendar detailing the days on which he does
not work, such as weekends and holidays. On a worker’s day
off, he does no work on his tasks. His tasks may not be scheduled
to start or end on these days. Tasks that are in process by the worker
are suspended during his days off. To find a solution to this problem
using CP Optimizer, you will use the three-stage method: describe,
model and solve. </p>
