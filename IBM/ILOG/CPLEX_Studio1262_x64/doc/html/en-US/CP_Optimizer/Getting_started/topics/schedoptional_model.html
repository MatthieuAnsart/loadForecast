<h1 class="title topictitle1">Model</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Once the house building with worker allocation
problem has been described using natural language, you then use Concert
Technology classes to model the constraint programming problem.</p>
<p class="p">After you have written a description of your problem,
you can use IBM® ILOG® Concert Technology
classes to model it. </p>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerschedoptional.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerschedoptional.159668"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 2: Open the example file</h2><p class="p">Open the
example file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/cpoptimizer/examples/tutorial/cpp/sched_optional_partial.cpp</samp> in
your development environment. This file is a program that is only
partially completed. You will enter the missing code in each step
in this lesson. At the end, you will have completed the program code,
and you can compile and run the program.</p>
<p class="p">In
this lesson, you include the header file <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;ilcp/cp.h&gt;</samp>.
To catch exceptions that may be thrown, you use a <samp class="ph codeph">try/catch</samp> block.
The code for creating the environment and model and for printing out
the solution found by the CP Optimizer engine is provided.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, the data related to the tasks, such as the tasks
(<samp class="ph codeph">Tasks</samp>), the number of tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">NbTasks</samp>),
the names of the tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">TaskNames</samp>) and sizes
of the tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">TaskDurations</samp>) and the data
related to the workers, such as the workers (<samp class="ph codeph">Workers</samp>),
number of workers (<samp class="ph codeph">NbWorkers</samp>) and the names
of workers (<samp class="ph codeph">WorkerNames</samp>), are provided.
The matrix of skill levels (<samp class="ph codeph">SkillsMatrix</samp>),
one level for each worker/task pair and functions to return the skill
level based on worker and task identifiers are also provided.</p>
<p class="p">After you create an environment and a model, you need to
define the decision variables and add the constraints and objective
to the model. Since the requirements for each of the five houses are
similar, you use a function <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp>. to
create the decision variables, constraints and objective associated
with each house. Information about individual houses that must be
shared with the main function includes the expressions needed to create
the objective function and, for each worker, the array of interval
variables associated with the worker, in order to create the constraint
regarding non overlapping intervals. In order to display the results
of the optimization, it is also useful to maintain an array of all
the interval variables. </p>
<p class="p">To access this information,
you create objects that will be updated in the <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp> function.
The objective expression is represented by the integer expression <samp class="ph codeph">skill</samp>. An array of task interval variables, <samp class="ph codeph">allTasks</samp>, stores all the interval variables that
are created. To maintain the interval variables related to each worker,
you use an array of arrays of interval variables called <samp class="ph codeph">workerTasks</samp>,
that will be filled by the calls to <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp>.</p>

</code></pre>
<p class="p">You need to pass the model, the objective
expression, the array of all tasks, the matrix of worker interval
variables, the house identifier and the overall deadline as arguments
to the <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp> function. </p>

<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerschedoptional.114936__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerschedoptional.159646"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 4: Create the MakeHouse function</h2><p class="p">Add the following
code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Create the MakeHouse function</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>void MakeHouse(IloModel model,
         IloIntExpr skill,
         IloIntervalVarArray allTasks,
         IloIntervalVarArray2 workerTasks,
         IloInt id,
         IloInt deadline) {
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Each house has a list of <samp class="ph codeph">NbTasks</samp> that
must be scheduled. Task <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>, where <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> is in <samp class="ph codeph">0..NbTasks-1</samp>,
has a size of <samp class="ph codeph">TaskDurations[i]</samp> and the name <samp class="ph codeph">TaskNames[i]</samp>.   Using these, you build an array <samp class="ph codeph">tasks</samp> of interval variables. </p>
<p class="p"> Each
task also requires one of the three workers from the start to the
end of the interval. The worker assigned must have a non-negative
level of skill on the task. To model this worker choice, you create
an array of interval variables, one interval variable for each possible
worker. You set these interval variables to be optional, so that each
one may or may not be present in the solution. You also add each interval
variable to the array <samp class="ph codeph">allTasks</samp> that will
be used to display the solution once the schedule has been determined.
You also store these interval variables in a matrix called <samp class="ph codeph">TaskMatrix</samp>, which is indexed on task and worker.
This matrix will be used within the <samp class="ph codeph">MakeHouse</samp> function
in a later step.</p>
<p class="p">If one of these interval variables
is present in the solution, then its presence must be counted in the
objective. Thus for each of these possible tasks, you increment the
objective by the product of the skill level and the expression representing
the presence of the time interval in the solution. The function <samp class="ph codeph">IloPresenceOf</samp> takes the environment and an interval
variable and returns a constraint that is true if the interval variable
is present and false if it is absent.</p>
<p class="p">To constrain
the solution so that exactly one of this array of interval variables
is to be present in the solution, you use the specialized constraint <samp class="ph codeph">IloAlternative</samp>.     </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Alternative intervals constraint</strong> </p>
 <p class="p"> With
the specialized constraint <samp class="ph codeph">IloAlternative</samp>,
you can create a constraint between an interval variable and a set
of interval variables that specifies that if the given interval variable
is present in the solution, then exactly one interval variable of
the set is present in the solution.</p>
 <p class="p">In other words,
consider an alternative constraint created with an interval variable <samp class="ph codeph">a</samp> and an array of interval variables <samp class="ph codeph">bs</samp>.
If <samp class="ph codeph">a</samp> is present in the solution, then exactly
one of the interval variables in <samp class="ph codeph">bs</samp> will
be present, and <samp class="ph codeph">a</samp> starts and ends together
with this chosen interval. If <samp class="ph codeph">a</samp> is absent
in the solution, then none of the interval variables in <samp class="ph codeph">bs</samp> will
be present. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">The first argument passed to the
constructor of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloAlternative</samp> is
the environment. The second argument is the interval variable. The
third argument is the array of interval variables that are the “alternatives".
The final argument is an optional name used for debug and trace purposes.
Here is a constructor:        </p>
