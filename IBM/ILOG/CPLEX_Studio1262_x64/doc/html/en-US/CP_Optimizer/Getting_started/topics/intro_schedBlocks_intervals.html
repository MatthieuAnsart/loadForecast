<h1 class="title topictitle1">Modeling time intervals in scheduling problems using interval
variables</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Time intervals are the definitions of activities, operations
or tasks to be completed. Time intervals are represented in CP Optimizer
by interval decision variables.</p>
<p class="p">In CP Optimizer, activities, operations and tasks are
represented as interval decision variables. </p>
<p class="p">An interval has a start, an end, a length and a size.
An interval variable allows for these values to be variable within
the model. The start is the lower endpoint of the interval and the
end is the upper endpoint of the interval. By default, the size is
equal to the length, which is the difference between the end and the
start of the interval. In general, the size is a lower bound on the
length.</p>
<p class="p">Also, an interval variable may be optional, and whether
or not an interval is present in the solution is represented by a
decision variable. If an interval is not present in the solution,
this means that any constraints on this interval act like the interval
is “not there.” Exact semantics will depend on the specific
constraint. </p>
<p class="p">In CP Optimizer, the optionality of an interval is captured
by the notion of a Boolean presence status associated with each interval
variable. Logical relations can be expressed between the presence
statuses of interval variables, allowing, for instance, to state that
whenever interval variable <samp class="ph codeph">a</samp> is present
then interval variable <samp class="ph codeph">b</samp> must also be present.</p>
