<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The first stage in finding a solution to the steel mill
problem is to describe the problem using natural language. </p>
<p class="p">In this lesson, you will solve an assignment problem.
A steel mill needs to process a batch of coil orders using steel slabs
of varying sizes. Each order has a size and a color associated with
it. This color represents the specific process used to build the coil.
A coil order must be built from only one slab. A slab can be used
to process multiple coil orders from the batch; however, there can
be at most two colors among the set of orders assigned to a given
slab.</p>
<p class="p">There are a finite number of slab sizes, but there are
an unlimited number of slabs of each size available. The cumulative
sum of the sizes of the coil orders assigned to a particular slab
is called its load. The load assigned to a slab must not exceed the
size, or capacity, of the slab. In addition, the production plan should
minimize the unused capacity, the waste, of the selected slabs.</p>
<p class="p">In the data set for this problem, there are 12 orders.
In this batch of orders, there are eight different colors represented.
As there are 12 orders and no order can be split among slabs, it is
possible to deduce that at most 12 slabs will be needed.</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">There are 12 orders of varying colors

<li class="li"><p class="p">There are steel slabs of various sizes

</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">What are the decision variables or unknowns in this problem? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The unknowns are what size slabs will
be selected and to which slab each order will be assigned. In other
words, there is a decision variable associated with each order that
indicates to which slab the order will be assigned. The domain of
each of these variables is the set of slabs, or [0..11]. This formulation
makes the assumption that the selected slabs have a placement, in
other words, there is a first slab, a second slab and so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">What are the constraints on these variables? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Each slab can be assigned orders of
at most two different colors. The load of a slab is equal to the cumulative
sum of the size of the orders assigned to it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">What is the objective? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The objective is to minimize loss, where
loss is the excess capacity of a slab, the unused capacity of the
selected slabs.</p>
