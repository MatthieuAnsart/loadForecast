<p class="p">The first line of data is the capacity of

<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Array of integer values </strong> </p>
 <p class="p"> Arrays of
integer values are represented by the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntArray</samp> in
the C++ API of Concert Technology. These arrays are extensible. </p>
 <p class="p"> When you use an array, you can access a value in that array
by its index, and the <samp class="ph codeph">operator[]</samp> is overloaded

 <p class="p">In the C# and Java™ APIs, the native arrays are used. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">The constructor of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntArray</samp> takes
an environment as its first argument. The second argument is the number
of integer values in the array, which is extensible. The elements
of the new array take the values that are passed as the remaining
arguments. Here is one constructor: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntArray(const IloEnv env, IloInt n, const IloInt v0, ...);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">In this lesson however, you create empty arrays
which will be filled directly from the data file. To do this, you
pass solely the first argument, the environment, to the constructor. </p>
<p class="p">You model the matrix of relative supply costs as an array
of arrays. To create this cost matrix, you use the Concert Technology
template <samp class="ph codeph">IloArray</samp>.  </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Extensible array</strong> </p>
 <p class="p">In the
C++ API, Concert Technology provides the template class <samp class="ph codeph">IloArray</samp> which
makes it easy for you to create classes of arrays for elements of
any given class. In other words, you can use this template to create
arrays of Concert Technology objects; you can also use this template
to create arrays of arrays (that is, multidimensional arrays). </p>
 <p class="p"> When you use an array, you can access a value in that array
by its index, and the <samp class="ph codeph">operator[]</samp> is overloaded

 <p class="p">The classes you create in this
way consist of extensible arrays. That is, you can add elements to
the array as needed.  </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">To model the supply

<p class="p">Now, you input the data from the data file.

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    file &gt;&gt; capacity &gt;&gt; fixedCost &gt;&gt; cost;

<p class="p">The number of stores can be deduced from the
size of the <samp class="ph codeph">cost</samp> matrix. The number of supplier
warehouses can be deduced from the size of the <samp class="ph codeph">capacity</samp> array.
Calculating these values from the data read from the file allows you
to easily extend the example by using another data file. The code
for determining the values of <samp class="ph codeph">nbLocations</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">nbStores</samp> is provided for you:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    nbLocations = capacity.getSize();
    nbStores = cost.getSize();
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Next, you represent the first set of unknowns
in this problem, the warehouse that will serve each store. IBM ILOG Concert
Technology gives you the means to represent these unknowns as an array
of constrained integer variables. You associate one decision variable
in the array with each store.  </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Array of decision variables</strong> </p>
 <p class="p"> In the
C++ API, arrays of constrained integer variables are represented by
the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntVarArray</samp> in Concert Technology. </p>
 <p class="p"> When you use an array, you can access a decision variable
in that array by its index, and the <samp class="ph codeph">operator[]</samp> is
overloaded for this purpose.</p>
 </div>
<p class="p">The constructor
of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntVarArray</samp> takes an environment
as its first argument. The second argument is the number of decision
variables in the array. Arrays are extensible, so you can later increase
or reduce the number of variables in the array. The third and fourth
arguments are the lower and upper bounds of the domain of possible
values for each variable in the array. When you use an array, you
can access a variable in that array by its index, and the operator<samp class="ph codeph">[]</samp> is overloaded for this purpose. Here is a constructor: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntVarArray (const IloEnv env,
                  IloInt n,
                  IloInt lb,
                  IloInt ub);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The first array of decision variables, called <samp class="ph codeph">supplier</samp>, represents which supplier warehouse should
supply each store. This array has <samp class="ph codeph">nbStores</samp> elements
or, in this example, 10. The domain of possible values for each of
these variables represent the supplier warehouses. In this example,
a value of 0 represents Bonn, a value of 1 represents Bordeaux, a
value of 2 represents London, a value of 3 represents Paris, and a
value of 4 represents Rome. </p>
<p class="p">For each store, the associated
decision variable in the array <samp class="ph codeph">supplier</samp> can
be assigned one value in a solution, so each solution will satisfy
the constraint that a store must be served by exactly one warehouse.
The array of decision variables <samp class="ph codeph">supplier</samp> will
represent the solution to the problem, after it has been solved.</p>

<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerfacility.135280__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerfacility.147882"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 5: Declare the supplier decision variables</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Declare
the supplier decision variables</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloIntVarArray supplier(env, nbStores, 0, nbLocations - 1);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To represent whether a potential supplier
warehouse site should be open or not, you declare another array of
decision variables, <samp class="ph codeph">open</samp>. It has <samp class="ph codeph">nbLocations</samp> elements or, in this example, 5. There
are two possible values for each variable, 0 and 1. The value of 1
indicates that the warehouse is open and 0 indicates that the warehouse
is not open.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerfacility.135280__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerfacility.147893"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 6: Declare the warehouse open decision variables</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Declare
the warehouse open decision variables</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloIntVarArray open(env, nbLocations, 0, 1);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Now you add the constraints. The first constraint
states that the supplier warehouse used by a given store must be open.
In other words, the warehouse must be open if a store is to be supplied
by it. For example, if store 0 is supplied by the Rome warehouse,
the constraint states that the variable of the <samp class="ph codeph">open</samp> array
that is associated with the Rome warehouse must be assigned the value
1. The Rome warehouse must be open.</p>
<p class="p">This interdependence
of the decision variable arrays <samp class="ph codeph">supplier</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">open</samp> is modeled through the use of an <em class="ph i">element
expression</em>.     </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Element

 <p class="p">The construction <samp class="ph codeph">T[i]

instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntVar</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">v</samp> is
an integer value) constrains the <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>-th element
of <samp class="ph codeph">T</samp> to be equal to <samp class="ph codeph">v</samp>. </p>
 <p class="p"> In the C# and Java APIs,
the respective methods <samp class="ph codeph">CP.Element</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.element</samp> are used to create an element expression. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">For each store <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>, the warehouse
that supplies that store is represented by <samp class="ph codeph">supplier[i]</samp>.
To indicate that <samp class="ph codeph">supplier[i]</samp> must be open,
you constrain <samp class="ph codeph">open[supplier[i]]</samp> to be assigned
the value 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerfacility.135280__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerfacility.147904"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 7: Add the constraints on open warehouses</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Add the constraint on open warehouses</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    for (i = 0; i &lt; nbStores; i++)
      model.add(open[supplier[i]] == 1);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Next, you need to compute the number of stores
being supplied by a particular warehouse and ensure that this value
does not exceed the capacity of the warehouse. You can use the IBM ILOG Concert
Technology function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCount</samp> to represent
the number of times a warehouse is assigned to be a supplier.     </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Counting expression</strong> </p>
 <p class="p"> Using the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCount</samp>, you
can create an <em class="ph i">expression</em> that represents the number
of times a particular value is assigned to the decision variables
in an array of constrained integer variables. </p>
 <p class="p"> Expressions
are discussed in further detail in the following step. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCount</samp> takes two
arguments, an array of decision variables and an integer value, and
returns an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntExprArg </samp>that
represents the number of times the value appears in the array. The
class <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntExprArg</samp> is used internally by IBM ILOG Concert
Technology to build expressions; you should not use <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntExprArg</samp> directly.
Here is the version of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCount</samp> that you
will use: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntExprArg IloCount(const IloIntVarArray vars, IloInt value);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">For each warehouse, you count the number of
times it appears in the array <samp class="ph codeph">supplier</samp> using
the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCount</samp>. You constrain this
expression to be no greater than the warehouse capacity using <samp class="ph codeph">operator&lt;=</samp>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerfacility.135280__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerfacility.147919"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 8: Add the constraints on warehouse capacity</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Add the capacity constraints</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    for (j = 0; j &lt; nbLocations; j++)
      model.add(IloCount(supplier, j)  &lt;= capacity[j]);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Finally, you consider the objective. The objective
in a constraint programming model is an <em class="ph i">expression</em> that
can be maximized or minimized. Expressions in IBM ILOG Concert
Technology are generally represented by the classes <samp class="ph codeph">IloExpr</samp> and
its subclasses <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntExpr</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumExpr</samp>.
    </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Expression </strong> </p>
 <p class="p"> Values may be combined with decision variables and other
expressions to form expressions. To combine values, variables and
other expressions to form an expression, you can use, among other
functions, the operators:  </p>
 <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">addition (<samp class="ph codeph">+</samp>),</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">subtraction (<samp class="ph codeph">-</samp>),</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">multiplication (<samp class="ph codeph">*</samp>),</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">division (<samp class="ph codeph">/</samp>),</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">self-assigned addition (<samp class="ph codeph">+=</samp>)
and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">self-assigned subtraction (<samp class="ph codeph">-=</samp>).</p>
 </li>
</ul>
 </div>
<p class="p">Many Concert Technology functions, such as <samp class="ph codeph">IloCount</samp>, return expressions. During search, expressions
have domains of possible values like decision variables. Unlike variables,
these domains are not stored but instead calculated based on the basic
elements of the expression.</p>
<p class="p">To build the objective
expression, you need to represent the sum of the fixed costs of all
the warehouses that are to be opened. This cost can be modeled as
the scalar product of the <samp class="ph codeph">fixedCost</samp> array
and the <samp class="ph codeph">open</samp> array. To express the fixed
cost expression, you use the Concert Technology function <samp class="ph codeph">IloScalProd</samp>.    </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Scalar product expression </strong> </p>
 <p class="p">Using the
function <samp class="ph codeph">IloScalProd</samp>, you can create an
expression that represents the scalar product of two arrays. </p>
 <p class="p">The scalar product is also called the inner product or the
weighted sum. </p>
 </div>
<p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">IloScalProd</samp> takes
two arguments, both arrays, and returns an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntExprArg</samp> that
represents the scalar product of the two arrays. Although you should
not use an <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntExprArg</samp> directly, it can
be cast to an <samp class="ph codeph">IloIntExpr</samp>, which you should
use instead. Here is the signature of the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloScalProd</samp> that
you will use: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloIntExprArg IloScalProd(const IloIntVarArray vars, 
                            const IloIntArray values);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">You declare the integer expression <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> to be the expression returned by the <samp class="ph codeph">IloScalProd</samp> function called with the arguments <samp class="ph codeph">open</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">fixedCost</samp>.  
To complete the objective expression, you must also add the supply
costs to it. To express the cost of supplying each store from the
warehouse selected to supply it, you use an element expression. For
each store <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>, the cost of supplying the
store from the assigned warehouse is <samp class="ph codeph">cost[i][supplier[i]]</samp>.
You can incrementally add these costs to the expression <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> by
using the self-assigned addition operator.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerfacility.135280__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerfacility.147930"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 9: Create the objective expression</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Build

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloIntExpr obj = IloScalProd(open, fixedCost);
    for (i = 0; i &lt; nbStores; i++)
      obj += cost[i][supplier[i]];
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To add the objective to the model, you first
use the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloMinimize</samp>, which creates
an instance of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloObjective</samp>. The
function <samp class="ph codeph">IloMinimize</samp> takes the environment
as its first argument and an expression as its second argument. The
last argument is an optional name used for debug and trace purposes.
Here is signature of the <samp class="ph codeph">IloMinimize</samp> function
that you will use: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloObjective IloMinimize(const IloEnv env,
                           const IloExpr expr, 
                           const char* name=0);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">You then use the member function <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel::add</samp> to add the objective to the model.
You must explicitly add an objective to the model or the CP Optimizer
engine will not use it in the search for a solution. If an objective
has been added to the model, the optimizer will search for an optimal
solution which minimizes the value of the objective.</p>
