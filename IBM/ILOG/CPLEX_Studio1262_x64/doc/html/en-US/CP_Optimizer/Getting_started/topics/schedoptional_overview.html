<p class="p">You will learn how to model and solve a house building
problem, a problem of scheduling the tasks involved in building multiple
houses. Some tasks must necessarily take place before other tasks,
and each task has a predefined size. Each house has a maximal completion
date. Moreover, there are three workers, and one of the three is required
for each task. The three workers have varying levels of skills with
regard to the various tasks; if a worker has no skill for a particular
task, he may not be assigned to the task. For some pairs of tasks,
if a particular worker performs one of the pair on a house, then the
same worker must be assigned to the other of the pair for that house.
The objective is to find a solution that maximizes the task associated
skill levels of the workers assigned to the tasks. To find a solution
to this problem using CP Optimizer, you will use the three-stage method:
describe, model and solve. </p>
