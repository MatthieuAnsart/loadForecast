<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The first stage in finding a solution to the sports scheduling
problem is to describe the problem using natural language.</p>
<p class="p">In this lesson, you will solve a sports league scheduling
problem. The league has 10 teams that play games over a season of
18 weeks. Each team has a home arena and plays every other team in
the league twice during the season, once in its home arena and once
in the opposing team’s home arena. For each of these games,
the team playing at its home arena is referred to as the home team;
the team playing at the opponent’s arena is called the away
team. There are 90 games altogether.</p>
<p class="p">Each of the 18 weeks in the season has five identical
slots to which games can be assigned. Each team plays once a week.
For each pair of teams, these two teams are opponents twice in a season;
these two games must be scheduled in different halves of the season.
Moreover, these two games must be scheduled at least six weeks apart.
A team must play at home either the first or last week but not both.</p>
<p class="p">A break is a sequence of consecutive weeks in which a
team plays its games either all at home or all away. No team can have
a break longer than two weeks. The objective in this problem is to
minimize the total number of breaks the teams play.</p>

write a natural language description of the problem, identifying the
variables and the constraints on these variables. </p>
<p class="p">Write a natural language description of this problem.

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">There are 10 teams.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">These teams play against one another
during a season of 18 weeks. There are 5 slots for games each week.</p>

<li class="li"><p class="p">Each team must play every other team
exactly twice, once in each team’s home arena. Each of these
90 games has a unique identifier in the range 0..89.</p>

<p class="p">What are the variables or unknowns in this problem?</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The unknown information is which of
the 90 games is played in each of the 90 slots. In other words, there
is a decision variable for each slot which indicates which game will
be assigned to it. Each of these constrained variables has a domain
of [0..89]; each integer of these domains is a game identifier.</p>
