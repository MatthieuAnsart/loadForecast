<h1 class="title topictitle1">Solve</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"> Once the team building problem has been described and
modeled, you use CP Optimizer classes and functions to solve the constraint
programming problem. </p>
<p class="p">Solving a problem using constraint programming consists
of assigning a value to each decision variable so that all constraints
are satisfied. You may not always know beforehand whether there is
a solution that satisfies all the constraints of the problem. In some
cases, there may be no solution. In other cases, there may be many
solutions to a problem. </p>
<p class="p">You use an instance of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp> to
solve a problem expressed in a model. The constructor for <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp> takes
an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel</samp> as an argument. </p>
<div class="section" id="migration.uss_gscpoptimizerdinner.144843__migration.uss_gscpoptimizerdinner.152333"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 20: Create an instance of IloCP</h2><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Create
an instance of IloCP</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    IloCP cp(model);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">In this problem, using the built-in search leads to a
long search time. To modify the search to make it more efficient,
you use a search tuning parameter to change the <em class="ph i">inference level</em> of the <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</samp> constraint.</p>
<p class="p">Each constraint is associated with a domain reduction
algorithm. This algorithm performs domain reductions based on the
associated constraint; the algorithm will remove values from the current
domains of variables that do not belong to a solution. Constraint
propagation is the mechanism used to communicate the effects of these
domain reductions. </p>
<p class="p">For some types of constraints, you can set an inference
level that specifies the type of domain reduction algorithm. For specialized
constraints such as <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</samp>, the reduction
algorithm varies depending on the inference level. This inference
level can be changed by setting a parameter on <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">To understand the difference between the inference levels,
consider the <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</samp> constraint. You
can view this constraint in two ways. It can be seen as a set of inequality
constraints or as one specialized constraint. For example, consider
a graph coloring problem with three nodes: <em class="ph i">x</em>, <em class="ph i">y</em> and <em class="ph i">z</em>. All the nodes must be colored
a different color. Node <em class="ph i">x</em> can
be colored red or blue; node <em class="ph i">y</em> can
be colored red or blue; and node <em class="ph i">z</em> can
be colored red, blue, or yellow. If you set the inference level of <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</samp> to
the basic level using the tuning parameter, the domain reduction algorithm
treats this specialized constraint as a set of inequality constraints.
Looking at each set of binary constraints individually, the domain
reduction algorithm is not able to reduce the domains.</p>
<p class="p">If you set the inference level of <samp class="ph codeph">IloAllDiff</samp> to
the extended level, the domain reduction algorithm treats this constraint
as a truly specialized constraint. The reduction algorithm is not
able to reduce the domains of <em class="ph i">x</em> and <em class="ph i">y</em>. However, the reduction algorithm
can “realize” that between them, variables <em class="ph i">x</em> and <em class="ph i">y</em> must
use both of the values red and blue. This leaves only the value of
yellow available for variable <em class="ph i">z</em>. </p>
<p class="p">Given that the extended level is the most thorough inference
level, why would you use any other inference level? There is a trade-off
in using the extended level. In general, the extended level takes
longer. The basic inference level is less thorough, but faster. The
medium level is a compromise between the two levels--faster than the
extended level and more thorough than the basic. However, these are
general rules and are not true for every situation. Depending on your
application, different inference levels may be appropriate. </p>
<p class="p">You use the member function <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::setParameter</samp> to
set the inference levels for specialized constraints. This function
takes two arguments: the first specifies the type of specialized constraint,
the second specifies the inference level.</p>
