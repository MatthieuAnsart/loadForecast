<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The three-stage method of constraint programming
using CP Optimizer involves describing, modeling and solving.</p>
<p class="p">To find a solution to a problem using CP Optimizer, you
use a three-stage method: describe, model and solve. </p>
<p class="p">The first stage is to <em class="ph i">describe</em> the problem
in natural language. For more information, see the section <a class="xref" href="intro_describe.html" title="The first stage in solving a constraint programming problem with CP Optimizer is to describe the problem using natural language.">Describe the problem</a>.</p>
<p class="p">The second stage is to use IBM® ILOG® Concert Technology classes
to <em class="ph i">model</em> the problem. The model is composed of decision
variables and constraints. <em class="ph i">Decision variables</em> are
the unknown information in a problem. Each decision variable has a <em class="ph i">domain</em> of possible <em class="ph i">values</em>. The <em class="ph i">constraints</em> are
limits or restrictions on combinations of values for these decision
variables. The model may also contain an <em class="ph i">objective,</em> an
expression that can be maximized or minimized. For more information,
see the section <a class="xref" href="intro__model.html" title="The second stage in solving a constraint programming problem with CP Optimizer is to model the problem. The model is composed of decision variables and constraints. The model may also contain an objective.">Model the problem</a>.</p>
<p class="p">The third stage is to use CP Optimizer classes to <em class="ph i">solve</em> the problem. Solving the problem consists of finding
a value for each decision variable while simultaneously satisfying
the constraints and maximizing or minimizing an objective, if one
is included in the model. The CP Optimizer<em class="ph i"> engine</em> (also
called “the optimizer”) uses two techniques for solving optimization
problems: <em class="ph i">constructive search</em> and<em class="ph i"> constraint
propagation</em>. For more information, see the section <a class="xref" href="intro_solve.html" title="The third stage in solving a constraint programming problem with CP Optimizer is to search for a solution and solve the problem.">Solve the problem</a>. </p>
<p class="p">In this lesson, you will describe, model and solve a simple
problem to understand the basic concepts in constraint programming.
The problem is to find values for <em class="ph i">x</em> and <em class="ph i">y</em> from
the following information:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><em class="ph i">x + y = 17</em></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><em class="ph i">x - y = 5</em></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><em class="ph i">x</em> can be any integer from
5 through 12</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><em class="ph i">y</em> can be any integer from
2 through 17</p>
</li>
</ul>
