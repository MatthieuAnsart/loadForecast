<h1 class="title topictitle1">Scheduling in CP Optimizer</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CP Optimizer offers classes and functions specially adapted
to modeling and solving problems in scheduling.</p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer offers features specially adapted to solving
problems in scheduling with continuous time and resource allocation.
There are, for example, classes of objects particularly designed to
represent such aspects as tasks and temporal constraints. CP Optimizer
offers you a workbench of modeling features that intuitively and naturally
tackle the issues inherent in scheduling and allocation problems. </p>
<p class="p">Scheduling with fine-grained time can be seen as the
process of assigning start and end times to intervals. Scheduling
problems also require the management of minimal or maximal capacity
constraints for resources over time.</p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer provides features for modeling and solving
scheduling problems where time intervals (activities, operations,
tasks) need to be placed in time and may have a resource allocation
aspect. </p>
<p class="p">There are many other scheduling problem types that can
be solved using CP Optimizer, such as: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">combined scheduling and planning problems, </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">combined scheduling and configuration
problems and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">combined scheduling and sequencing problems. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Within these different problem types, a wide variety
of constraints may need to be satisfied. Different environments are
subject to different constraints which contribute to the complexity
of the problem. For example, one factory scheduling problem may involve
only machines as resources, while another may also require the consideration
of the abilities of human operators. There also exists a wide variety
in the size of scheduling problems. This size may vary from a few
dozen activities to hundreds of thousands of activities.</p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer can be used to create a variety of scheduling
applications, including: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">personnel and equipment scheduling for
installation, maintenance and repair activities, </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">finite capacity production scheduling, </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">project planning and scheduling and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">logistic resources scheduling. </p>
</li>
</ul>
