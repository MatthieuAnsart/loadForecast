<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Transition based scheduling has been introduced in this
version of CP Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer V12.2 provides new features (integer expressions
and constraints) allowing for easier modeling of problems that involve
constraints and costs related with the transitions between activities
executed on a unary resource. For instance, it is now possible to
model transition costs or transition times that hold between immediate
successors in a sequence. Furthermore, constraints between sequence
variables, such as in permutation flow-shop problems, are now easier
to handle.</p>
<p class="p">For more information on the new transition based scheduling
API, please refer to the concept “Interval variables sequencing”
in the <em class="ph i">CP Optimizer C++ API Reference
Manual</em> and to the sections <a class="xref" href="../../User_manual/topics/designsched_setup.html" title="Setup times on disjunctive resources can be modeled by a no-overlap constraint with a transition distance.">Modeling sequence-dependent setup times</a> and <a class="xref" href="../../User_manual/topics/designsched_costs.html" title="Classical scheduling costs such as makespan, earliness/tardiness, resource allocation costs and activity execution costs can be modeled efficiently in CP Optimizer.">Modeling classical scheduling costs</a> in the <em class="ph i">CP
Optimizer User’s Manual</em>.</p>
<p class="p">CP Optimizer V12.2 comes with 3 illustrative examples
for transition-based modeling:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sched_setup</samp>:
 transition times between immediate successors and forbidden transitions
in a sequence,</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sched_tcost</samp>:
minimization of total transition cost, and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sched_pflowshop</samp>:
permutation flow-shop problem.</p>

</ul>
