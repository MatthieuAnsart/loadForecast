<h1 class="title topictitle1">New feature: Presolve</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Presolve has been introduced in this version of CP Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">With this release, CP Optimizer presolves the input model before
search. Presolve consists in modifying the model to improve it so
that it can be solved more efficiently. </p>
<p class="p">Presolve works by</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">simplifying the model by reducing linear constraints by removing
redundancies and fixed expressions and</li>
<li class="li">strengthening the model to achieve more domain reduction by aggregating
constraints or factorizing common subexpressions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Presolve can be helpful on models that are not well formulated
due to the model itself or to the model data.   The activation of
presolve is controlled by a new parameter. In the <strong class="ph b">C++ API</strong>,
the parameter is <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::Presolve</samp> which can be set
to <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::On</samp> (the default) or <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP::Off</samp>.
In the <strong class="ph b">Java™ API</strong>, the
parameter is <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP.IntParam.Presolve</samp>. In the <strong class="ph b">C#
API</strong>, the parameter is <samp class="ph codeph">CP.IntParam.Presolve</samp>.</p>
<p class="p"> The constraint aggregation parameter has been deprecated and ineffective.
Constraint aggregation is now a part of presolve, and, to activate
or deactivate it, the presolve parameter must be used.</p>
<div class="p">As a consequence, the overall engine memory consumption can increase
because an internal model is created to perform the improvement operations.
The presolve transformations are displayed in the output log of CP
Optimizer. For example the line<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>! Presolve      : 6942 extractables eliminated, 158 constraints generated</code></pre>
at
the beginning of the search shows that presolve as eliminated 6942
constraints or expressions and that a subset of constraints were aggregated
to 158 constraints.</div>
