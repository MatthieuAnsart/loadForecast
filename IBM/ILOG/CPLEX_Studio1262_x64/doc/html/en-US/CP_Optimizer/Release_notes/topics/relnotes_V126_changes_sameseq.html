<body role="main" id="newfeaturesame-sequenceconstraints">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">New feature: Same-sequence constraints and same-common-subsequence
constraints </h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">New constraints have been added on sequence variables. </p>
<p class="p">The new <samp class="ph codeph">sameSequence</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">sameCommonSubsequence</samp> constraints
are binary constraints on a pair of sequence variables <samp class="ph codeph">seq1</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">seq2</samp>.
The <samp class="ph codeph">sameCommonSubsequence</samp> constraint states that
the relative position of some related subsets of interval variables
is the same in both sequences. Typically, if interval <samp class="ph codeph">a</samp> is
before interval <samp class="ph codeph">b</samp> in sequence <samp class="ph codeph">seq1</samp> then
the interval related to <samp class="ph codeph">a</samp> (if present) is before
the interval related to <samp class="ph codeph">b</samp> (if present) in sequence <samp class="ph codeph">seq2</samp>.
The <samp class="ph codeph">sameSequence</samp> is a stronger constraint that also
states that each interval variable in a sequence must have a related
interval variable in the other sequence and that these intervals must
have the same presence status (full mapping).  </p>
<div class="p">Here are two examples of use-cases where these constraints are
useful: <ul class="ul"><li class="li">First in/first out and no-bypass constraints. In some physical
systems like trains on a single line railway or items on a conveyor
belt, bypassing is not possible and items must enter and exit a given
section of the system in the same order. If entering and exiting the
sections or the junctions of the system is modeled by two related
interval variables, those constraints can be modeled by <samp class="ph codeph">sameSequence</samp> constraints
(or <samp class="ph codeph">sameCommonSubsequence</samp> constraints if the items
do not follow the same path) on the sequences of entering and exiting
intervals. A classical example of such a constraint is the permutation
flow-shop scheduling problem.</li>
<li class="li">Scenario-Based approaches for scheduling with uncertainties. In
the presence of uncertainties (for instance, uncertain activity durations)
one may be interested in building sequences of activities on unary
resources that optimize some robustness or statistical criterion (for
instance, the expected makespan). A scenario is a sub-model that defines
a particular realization of the uncertainties in the environment.
As one must find robust sequences that optimize some criterion over
all scenarios, the different sequences of a given unary resource across
all scenarios are linked with <samp class="ph codeph">sameSequence</samp> constraints.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">Two examples are provided in the distribution that illustrate the
use of same-sequence constraints. The permutation flow-shop scheduling
problem is described in the C++ API in file<span class="ph filepath"> sched_pflowshop.cpp</span>,
in the Java™ API in file <span class="ph filepath">SchedPFlowShop.java</span>,
and in the C# API in file <span class="ph filepath">SchedPFlowShop.cs</span>.
An example of stochastic job-shop scheduling problem is illustrated
in the C++ API in file <span class="ph filepath">sched_stochastic_jobshop.cpp</span>,
in the Java API in file <span class="ph filepath">SchedStochasticJobShop.java</span>,
and in the C# API in file <span class="ph filepath">SchedStochasticJobShop.cs</span>. </p>
