<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Introduces cumulative functions to the house building problem.</p>
<p class="p">In this section, you will learn how to:</p>

</ul>
<p class="p">You will learn how to model and solve a house building problem, a problem of scheduling the tasks involved in building multiple houses in such a manner that minimizes the overall completion date of the houses. Some tasks must necessarily take place before other tasks, and each task has a predefined duration. Moreover, there are three workers, and each task requires any one of the three workers. A worker can be assigned to at most one task at a time. In addition, there is a cash budget with a starting balance. Each task consumes a certain amount of the budget at the start of the task, and the cash balance is increased every 60 days. To find a solution to this problem using IBM ILOG OPL, you will use the three-stage method: describe, model, and solve.</p>
</div>

<div class="body"><p class="p">The problem consists of assigning start dates to a set of tasks in such a way that the schedule satisfies temporal constraints and minimizes a criterion. The criterion for this problem is to minimize the overall completion date. Each task requires 200 dollars per day of the task, payable at the start of the task. Every 60 days, starting at day 0, the amount of 30,000 dollars is added to the cash balance.</p>
<p class="p">For each task type in the house building project, the following table shows the duration of the task in days along with the tasks that must be finished before the task can start. Each task requires any one of the three workers. A worker can only work on one task at a time; each task, once started, may not be interrupted.</p>

<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="hWRxtfn9"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Model</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="p">After you have written a description of your problem, you can use the OPL language to model and solve it.</p>
<div class="section" id="hWRxtfn9__pAzoQPzl"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Step 2: Open the example file</h3><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Still working with the <span class="ph uicontrol">scheduling_tutorial</span> project, open the <span class="ph uicontrol">sched_cumul.mod</span> file in the CPLEX Studio IDE.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">This file is an OPL model that is only partially completed. You will add the missing code in each step of this lesson. At the end, you will have completed the OPL model.</p>
<p class="p">The code for reading the data into the data structures from the data file is provided.</p>
<p class="p">In the related data file, the data provided includes the number of houses (<samp class="ph codeph">NbHouses</samp>), the number of workers (<samp class="ph codeph">NbWorkers</samp>), the names of the tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">TaskNames</samp>), the sizes of the tasks (<samp class="ph codeph">Duration</samp>), the precedence relations (<samp class="ph codeph">Precedences</samp>), and the earliest start dates of the houses (<samp class="ph codeph">ReleaseDate</samp>).</p>
<p class="p">As each house has an earliest starting date, you declare the task interval variables to have a start date no earlier than that release date of the associated house. The ending dates of the tasks are not constrained, so the upper value of the range for the variables is <span class="keyword apiname">maxint</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hWRxtfn9__vIvSY4iZ"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Step 3: Create the interval variables</h3><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Create the interval variables</samp>:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>dvar interval itvs[h in Houses][t in TaskNames] in ReleaseDate[h]..(maxint div 2)-1 size Duration[t];</code></pre>
<p class="p">As the workers are equivalent in this problem, it is better to represent them as one pool of workers instead of as individual workers with no overlap constraints as was done in the earlier examples. The expression representing usage of this pool of workers can be modified by the interval variables that require a worker.</p>
<p class="p">To model both the limited number of workers and the limited budget, you need to represent the sum of the individual contributions associated with the interval variables. In the case of the cash budget, some tasks consume some of the budget at the start. In the case of the workers, a task requires the worker only for the duration of the task. IBM ILOG OPL provides the keyword <span class="keyword apiname">cumulFunction</span> to represent the sum of individual contributions of interval variables.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cumulative function expression</strong></p>
 <p class="p">A cumulative function expression, represented in IBM ILOG OPL by <span class="keyword apiname">cumulFunction</span>, can be used to model a resource usage function over time. This function can be computed as a sum of interval variable demands on a resource over time.</p>
 <p class="p">An interval usually increases the cumulated resource usage function at its start time and decreases it when it releases the resource at its end time (pulse function).</p>
 <p class="p">For resources that can be produced and consumed by activities (for instance the contents of an inventory or a tank), the resource level can also be described as a function of time. A production activity will increase the resource level at the start or end time of the activity whereas a consuming activity will decrease it. The cumulated contribution of activities on the resource can be represented by a function of time, and constraints can be modeled on this function (for instance, a maximal or a safety level).</p>
 <p class="p">The value of the expression at any given moment in time is constrained to be nonnegative. A cumulative function expression can be modified with the atomic demand keywords:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">step</span>, which increases or decreases the level of the function by a given amount at a given time; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">pulse</span>, which increases or decreases the level of the function by a given amount for the length of a given interval variable or fixed interval;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">stepAtStart</span>, which increases or decreases the level of the function by a given amount at the start of a given interval variable;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">stepAtEnd</span>, which increases or decreases the level of the function by a given amount at the end of a given interval variable.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
 <p class="p">A cumulative function expression can be constrained to model limited resource capacity by constraining that the function be ≤ the capacity.</p>
 </div>
<p class="p">You create two cumulative functions, one to represent the usage of the workers and the other to represent the cash balance.</p>
<p class="p">Each task requires one worker from the start to the end of the task interval. To represent the fact that a worker is required for the task, you create a cumulative function expression, <samp class="ph codeph">workerUsage</samp>. This function will be constrained to not exceed the number of workers at any point in time. The keyword <span class="keyword apiname">pulse</span> adjusts the expression by a given amount on the interval. Summing these pulse atoms over all the interval variables results in an expression that represents worker usage over the entire time frame for building the houses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hWRxtfn9__KM8VXXNE"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Step 4: Declare the worker usage function</h3><p class="p">Add the following code after the comment <samp class="ph codeph">//Declare the worker usage function</samp>:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cumulFunction workersUsage = 
   sum(h in Houses, t in TaskNames) pulse(itvs[h][t],1);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To model the cash budget, you create a cumulative function expression, <samp class="ph codeph">cash</samp>. To set the initial cash balance of 30,000 dollars and increase the balance by 30,000 every sixty days, you use the keyword <span class="keyword apiname">step</span>, which can be used to increment or decrement the cumulative function expression by a fixed amount on a given date.</p>
<p class="p">Each task requires a cash payment equal to 200 dollars a day for the length of the task, payable at the start of the task. The keyword <span class="keyword apiname">stepAtStart</span> is used to adjust the cash balance cumulative function expression the appropriate amount for every task. </p>

<p class="p">The tasks have precedence constraints that are added to the model.</p>
