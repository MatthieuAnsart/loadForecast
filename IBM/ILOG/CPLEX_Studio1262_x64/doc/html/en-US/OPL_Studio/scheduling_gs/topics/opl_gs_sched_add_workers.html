<p class="p">You will learn how to model and solve a problem of scheduling the
tasks involved in building multiple houses in a manner that minimizes
the costs associated with completing each house after a given due
date and with the length of time it takes to build each house. Some
tasks must necessarily take place before other tasks, and each task
has a predefined duration. Each house has an earliest starting date.
Moreover, there are two workers, each of whom must perform a given
subset of the necessary tasks, and there is a transition time associated
with a worker transferring from one house to another house. A task,
once started, cannot be interrupted. The objective is to minimize
the cost, which is composed of tardiness costs for certain tasks as
well as a cost associated with the length of time it takes to complete
each house. To find a solution to this problem using IBM ILOG OPL,
you will use the three-stage method: describe, model, and solve.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="nJNednRZ"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Describe</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="p">The problem consists of assigning start dates to a set of tasks
in such a way that the schedule satisfies temporal constraints and
minimizes a criterion. The criterion for this problem is to minimize
the tardiness costs associated with completing each house later than
its specified due date and the cost associated with the length of
time it takes to complete each house.</p>
<p class="p">For each task type in the house building project, the following
table shows the duration of the task in days along with the tasks
that must be finished before the task can start. In addition, each
type of task must be performed by a specific worker, Jim or Joe. A
worker can only work on one task at a time; a task, once started,
may not be interrupted. The time required to transfer from one house
to another house is determined by a function based on the location
of the two houses.</p>

<p class="p">One
part of the objective is based on the length of time it takes to build

each house interval variable to have a start date no earlier than

 <p class="p">Given an interval variable <samp class="ph codeph">a1</samp> that

<p class="p">Each

only one task at a time, it is necessary to know all of the tasks
that a worker must perform and then constrain that these intervals
not overlap and respect the transition times.</p>
<p class="p">A sequence variable
represents the order in which the workers perform the tasks. Note
that the sequence variable does not force the tasks to not overlap
or the order of tasks; in a later step you will create a constraint

 <p class="p">Using the decision variable type <span class="keyword apiname">sequence</span> in

or be empty. In a solution, the sequence will represent a total order
over all the intervals in the set that are present in the solution.</p>
 <p class="p">The
assigned order of interval variables in the sequence does not necessarily
determine their relative positions in time in the schedule.</p>
 </div>
<p class="p">The
sequence variable takes an array of interval variables as well as
the transition types for each of those variables. You create interval
sequence variables for Jim and Joe, using the arrays of their tasks

<p class="p">Now that you have created the sequence variables, you
must constrain each sequence such that the interval variables do not

a chain of non-overlapping intervals that are present in the solution.
If a set of transition tuples is specified, it defines the minimal

 <p class="p">Note
that intervals which are not present in the solution are automatically
removed from the sequence.</p>

<p class="p">The cost for building a house is the sum of the tardiness

are two ways of solving the model:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Execute the model in the CPLEX Studio IDE. You can view the
results in a Gantt chart; see <a class="xref" href="opl_gs_sched_add_workers.html#section1269021389278">Viewing the results of sequencing problems in a Gantt chart</a>.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Execute the model using <samp class="ph codeph">oplrun</samp>. You will need
to pass as arguments not only the model file but also the data file, <span class="ph filepath">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/opl/examples/opl/tutorial/sched_sequence.dat</span>.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">You can view the complete model online in the file:</p>

<div class="body"><p class="p">After solving a problem, the Problem Browser view shows both data
and decision variable values. If the problem includes a scheduling
variable, the value of the variable is displayed.</p>
<p class="p">The sample model:</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">&lt;Install_dir&gt;/opl/examples/opl/sched_sequence/sched_sequence.mod</samp> </p>
<p class="p">includes a sequence variable array. After the model is solved,
the sequence value is displayed in the Problem Browser.</p>
<p class="p">Detailed information can be viewed by clicking the button <img class="image" src="../../gsoplide/images/dataview_button.jpg" alt="Show data view button" /> <span class="ph uicontrol">Show data view</span>.
The button appears when the mouse hovers over a variable name.</p>
<p class="p">The following screen shows the button next to the decision variable <samp class="ph codeph">workers</samp>.</p>
<div class="image"><img class="image" src="../../gsoplide/images/pbbrowser_sequence.jpg" alt="Problem Browser showing View Data button." /></div><p class="p">This button opens a new tab in the central window and shows the
array in a tabular view. In the case of a sequence array, a <span class="ph uicontrol">Gantt
Chart</span> tab in the bottom left of the window allows you
to open a Gantt Chart.</p>
<div class="image"><img class="image" src="../../gsoplide/images/gantt_sequence.jpg" alt="Gant Chart showing results of sched_sequence.mod" /></div><p class="p">For each sequence of the array, the intervals are displayed on
the same horizontal line. The <samp class="ph codeph">noOverlap</samp> constraint,
if posted in the problem model, can be checked visually on this line.</p>
