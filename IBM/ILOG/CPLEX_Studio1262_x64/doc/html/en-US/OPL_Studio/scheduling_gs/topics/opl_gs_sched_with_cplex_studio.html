<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="VK3Sb4cl"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Scheduling building blocks</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="p">Scheduling is the act of creating a schedule, which is a timetable
for planned occurrences. Scheduling may also involve allocating resources
to activities over time. A scheduling problem can be viewed as a constraint
satisfaction problem or as a constrained optimization problem, but
regardless of how it is viewed, a scheduling problem is defined by:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">A set of time intervals--definitions of activities, operations,
or tasks to be completed</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">A set of temporal constraints--definitions of possible relationships
between the start and end times of the intervals</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">A set of specialized constraints--definitions of the complex
relationships on a set of intervals due to the state and finite capacity
of resources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In CPLEX Studio, a scheduling project contains one or more model
files and, optionally, one or more data files and one or more settings
files. The following sections provide deeper explanations of how the
OPL language facilitates the representation of scheduling problems.</p>
<div class="section" id="VK3Sb4cl__OLOp6dcQ"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">The model files</h3><p class="p">Model files (<span class="ph filepath">.mod</span> extension)
contain all of the OPL statements. The following components are usually
present in a model file:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">the declarations of data</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the declarations of decision variables</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the declaration of engine</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">an objective function</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the constraints</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">script statements.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The data, the objective function, and scripting statements
are not mandatory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="VK3Sb4cl__bCWVM55n"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Declarations of data</h3><p class="p">Data declarations allow you to name your
data so that you can reference it easily in your model. For example,
if your data in a table defines the cost of shipping one unit of material
from location <em class="ph i">i</em> to location <em class="ph i">j</em>, you might want to call
your item of data <strong class="ph b">cost</strong><em class="ph i">ij</em> where <em class="ph i">i=1,..., n</em>, <em class="ph i">j=1,...,
n</em>, and <em class="ph i">n</em> is the number of locations in your model. You
tell OPL that your model uses this data by declaring:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   int n = ... ;
   float cost[1..n][1..n] = ... ;</code></pre>
<p class="p">The … (ellipsis) means
that the actual values for your table are located in a data file,
which must be listed in the current project.</p>
<p class="p">You could also
list the data explicitly in the model file. However, it is recommended
that you construct model files without specifying values for data
so that you can later easily solve many instances of the same model
by simply changing the data file.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">int</samp> type
declared means that the numbers in the data file must be integers.
If the numbers in the data file are floating-point numbers, use the <span class="keyword apiname">float</span> type
instead. </p>
 </div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="VK3Sb4cl__Jbaatzg4"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Declarations of decision variables</h3><p class="p">Variable
declarations name and define the type of each variable in the model.
For example, if you want to create a variable that equals the amount
of material shipped from location <em class="ph i">i</em> to location <em class="ph i">j</em>, you
can create a variable named <strong class="ph b">ship</strong><em class="ph i">ij</em>:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   dvar int+ ship[1..n][1..n];</code></pre>
<p class="p">The <span class="keyword apiname">dvar</span> keyword
indicates that you are declaring a decision variable. Since <samp class="ph codeph">int+</samp> indicates
that the variables are nonnegative, this statement declares an array
of nonnegative integer variables.</p>
<p class="p">There is a restriction for
constraint programming in OPL; float decision variables cannot be
used. Instead, if you need to set constraints on float expressions,
you should use <span class="keyword apiname">float dexpr</span>; see the section <a class="xref" href="../../opllangref/topics/opl_langref_expressions_int.html" title="Describes the use of constants, data, decision variables, and operators within OPL expressions.">Integer and float expressions</a> in
the <em class="ph i">Language Reference Manual</em>.</p>
<p class="p">For
scheduling there are specific additional decision variables, namely:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">interval</span></p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">sequence</span></p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In OPL, activities, operations and tasks are represented as
interval decision variables.</p>
<p class="p">An interval has a start, an end,
a length, and a size. An interval variable allows for these values
to be variable within the model. The start is the lower endpoint of
the interval and the end is the upper endpoint of the interval. By
default, the size is equal to the length, which is the difference
between the end and the start of the interval. In general, the size
is a lower bound on the length.</p>
<p class="p">Also, an interval variable may
be optional, and whether or not an interval is present in the solution
is represented by a decision variable. If an interval is not present
in the solution, this means that any constraints on this interval
acts like the interval is “not there.” The exact semantics will depend
on the specific constraint.</p>
<p class="p">The following example contains a
two-dimensional array of interval decision variables where the sizes
of the interval variables are fixed:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>dvar interval itvs  [h in Houses][t in TaskNames] size Duration[t];</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="VK3Sb4cl__fMoMv8Pu"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Declaration of engine</h3><p class="p">A scheduling model starts with the declaration
of the engine as follows:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>using CP;</code></pre>
<p class="p">This
declaration tells OPL to use the CP engine to solve the problem. In
addition, it allows the use of constraints that are specific to constraint
programming or to scheduling.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="VK3Sb4cl__zyLHboVE"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Objective function</h3><p class="p">The objective function is an expression that
you want to optimize. This function must consist of variables and
data that you have declared earlier in the model file. The objective
function is introduced by either the <span class="keyword apiname">minimize</span> or
the <span class="keyword apiname">maximize</span> keyword. For example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   minimize endOf(tasks["moving"]);</code></pre>
<p class="p">This
statement indicates that you want to minimize the end of the interval
variable <samp class="ph codeph">tasks["moving"]</samp>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="VK3Sb4cl__J66P9wCO"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Constraints</h3><p class="p">Constraints
indicate the conditions necessary for a feasible solution to your
model. You declare constraints within a <samp class="ph codeph">subject to</samp> block.
For example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   subject to {
     forall(t in Tasks)
       forall(s in successors[t])
         endBeforeStart(tasks[t], tasks[s]);
   }</code></pre>
<p class="p">This statement declares one set of precedence constraints.</p>
<p class="p">Several
types of constraints can be placed on interval variables:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">precedence constraints, which ensure that relative positions
of intervals in the solution (For example a precedence constraint
can model a requirement that an interval <samp class="ph codeph">a</samp> must end
before interval <samp class="ph codeph">b</samp> starts, optionally with some minimum
delay <samp class="ph codeph">z</samp>);</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">no overlap constraints, which ensure that positions of intervals
in the solution are disjointed in time;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">span constraints, which ensure that one interval to cover those
intervals in a set of intervals;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">alternative constraints, which ensure that exactly one of a
set of intervals be present in the solution;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">synchronize constraints, which ensure that a set of intervals
start and end at the same time as a given interval variable if it
is present in the solution;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">cumulative expression constraints, which restrict the bounds
on the domains of cumulative expressions.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="VK3Sb4cl__qIfviiIw"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Script statements</h3><p class="p">Between the various blocks of a model (declaration
of data, declaration of variables, constraints) or after the constraints,
it is possible to add some script statements. This is useful for instance
to preprocess input data, display it, or to display result data. These
statements are written in IBM ILOG Script, an extension of the JavaScript
language for OPL.</p>
<p class="p">IBM
ILOG Script for OPL enables you to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">add preprocessing instructions to prepare data for the model;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">control the flow while the model is solved;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">set CPLEX parameters, CP Optimizer parameters, CP Optimizer
search phases, and OPL options;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">add postprocessing instructions to aggregate, transform, and
format data (including results data) for display or for sending to
another application, for example, a spreadsheet;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">solve repeated instances of the same model;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">create algorithmic solutions where the output of one model
instance is used as the input of a second model instance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When you use IBM ILOG Script for OPL, you avoid having to
compile and link; you just add script statements to your model file.</p>
<p class="p">There
are two possible top-level statements:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">the <samp class="ph codeph">main</samp> statement for a flow control script,
and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp> statement for preprocessing and
postprocessing scripts.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   minimize endOf(tasks["moving"]);
   subject to {
     ...
   }
   
   execute DISPLAY {
     writeln("end=", tasks["moving"].end);
   }</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="VK3Sb4cl__oDVJwOm4"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Data files</h3><p class="p">You can organize
large problems better by separating the model of the problem from
the instance data. In this case, you store the instance data in one
or more data files (<span class="ph filepath">.dat</span> extension). Data files
store the actual values of the data used in the model. A data file
will look something like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  n = 3;

  c = [[0.0 1.5 2.3]
      [1.5 0.0 3.7]
      [2.3 3.7 0.0]];</code></pre>
<p class="p">Each data file may specify one or more connections
to data sources, such as a relational database or a spreadsheet, to
read and write data. From the IDE, you can export external data and
internal data to a <span class="ph filepath">.dat</span> file, which you can later
use as input. Only the data actually used in the model is exported
to data files.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="F1D5Sv1o"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Execute and test</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="p">In future sections, you will work through tutorials by describing,
modeling, and solving problems using IBM ILOG CPLEX Studio. In this
section, you are provided with a completed example model so that you
can test your installation of CPLEX Studio. In the next section, <em class="ph i">Modeling
and Solving a Simple Problem: House Building</em>, you will learn about
the language features used in this model.</p>
<div class="section" id="F1D5Sv1o__ERWHdJpW"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Description of the problem</h3><p class="p">The
problem is a house building problem in which there are ten tasks of
fixed size, each of which needs to be assigned a starting time. The
statements for creating the interval variables that represent the
tasks are: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>using CP;

dvar interval masonry    size 35;
dvar interval carpentry  size 15;
dvar interval plumbing   size 40;
dvar interval ceiling    size 15;
dvar interval roofing    size 5;
dvar interval painting   size 10;
dvar interval windows    size 5;
dvar interval facade     size 10;
dvar interval garden     size 5;
dvar interval moving     size 5;</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="F1D5Sv1o__kWh46pxl"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Adding the constraints</h3><p class="p">The
constraints in this problem are precedence constraints; some tasks
cannot start until other tasks have ended. For example, the ceilings
must be completed before painting can begin. The set of precedence
constraints for this problem can be added to the model with the block:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>subject to {
  endBeforeStart(masonry,   carpentry);
  endBeforeStart(masonry,   plumbing);
  endBeforeStart(masonry,   ceiling);
  endBeforeStart(carpentry, roofing);
  endBeforeStart(ceiling,   painting);
  endBeforeStart(roofing,   windows);
  endBeforeStart(roofing,   facade);
  endBeforeStart(plumbing,  facade);
  endBeforeStart(roofing,   garden);
  endBeforeStart(plumbing,  garden);
  endBeforeStart(windows,   moving);
  endBeforeStart(facade,    moving);
  endBeforeStart(garden,    moving);
  endBeforeStart(painting,  moving);
}</code></pre>
<p class="p">Here there is a special constraint, <span class="keyword apiname">endBeforeStart</span>,
which ensures that one interval variable ends before the other starts.
This constraint has a special treatment in the engine. One reason
is to correctly treat the presence of intervals so that if one of
the interval variables is not present, the constraint is automatically
satisfied, and another reason is for stronger inference in constraint
propagation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="F1D5Sv1o__TpP7P6uu"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Displaying the solution</h3><p class="p">The
interval variables and precedence constraints completely describe
this simple problem. An <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp> block is used to
display a solution to the model, after values have been assigned to
the start and end of each of the interval variables in the model.
The last part of the code for this example is:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>execute {
  writeln("Masonry  : " + masonry.start   + ".." + masonry.end);
  writeln("Carpentry: " + carpentry.start + ".." + carpentry.end);
  writeln("Plumbing : " + plumbing.start  + ".." + plumbing.end);
  writeln("Ceiling  : " + ceiling.start   + ".." + ceiling.end);
  writeln("Roofing  : " + roofing.start   + ".." + roofing.end);
  writeln("Painting : " + painting.start  + ".." + painting.end);
  writeln("Windows  : " + windows.start   + ".." + windows.end);
  writeln("Facade   : " + facade.start    + ".." + facade.end);
  writeln("Garden   : " + garden.start    + ".." + garden.end);
  writeln("Moving   : " + moving.start    + ".." + moving.end);
}</code></pre>
