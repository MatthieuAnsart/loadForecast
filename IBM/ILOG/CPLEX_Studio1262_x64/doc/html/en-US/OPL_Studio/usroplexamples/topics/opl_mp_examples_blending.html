<h1 class="title topictitle1">Blending problems</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes examples in the CPLEX Studio distribution that
involve blending several resources or materials to create other products
corresponding to a demand.</p>
<p class="p">Blending problems are a typical application of mixed
integer-linear programming (MILP). They involve blending several resources
or materials to create one or more products corresponding to a demand.</p>
<p class="p">Mixed integer-linear programs are linear programs in
which some variables are required to take integer values. </p>
<p class="p">Such programs are solved using the same technology as
integer programs. A branch-and-bound algorithm can exploit the linear
relaxation; its branching procedure is applied only to the integer
variables. </p>
<p class="p">This section contains information on the following distributed
examples:</p>

to form an alloy. The metal may come from several sources: in pure
form, from raw materials, as scraps from previous mixes, or as ingots.
The alloy must contain certain amounts of the various metals, as expressed
by a production constraint specifying lower and upper bounds for the
quantity of each metal in the alloy. Each source has a cost and the
problem consists of blending from the sources while minimizing the
cost and satisfying the production constraint. Similar problems arise
in other domains, for example, the oil, paint, and food-processing
industries.</p>

by blending different types of crude oil. Each type of gasoline must
satisfy quality criteria with respect to its lead content and octane
rating. The company must satisfy customer demand for each blend. It
can purchase each type of crude oil outside or process it inside,
with associated costs. The company has the option of advertising a
type of gasoline, in which case the demand for this type increases
in proportion to the amount spent. The problem consists of minimizing
costs while satisfying demand and applying appropriate advertising.</p>

oil, organized in two categories (two kinds of vegetable oils and
three kinds of non vegetable oils) into batches of blended products
over six months.</p>
<p class="p">Some of the oil is already available in storage. There
is an initial stock of oil of 500 tons of each raw type when planning
begins. An equal stock should exist in storage at the end of the plan.
Up to 1000 tons of each type of raw oil can be stored each month for
later use. The price for storage of raw oils is 5 monetary units per
ton. Refined oil cannot be stored. The blended product cannot be stored
either.</p>
<p class="p">The rest of the oil (that is, any not available in storage)
must be bought in quantities to meet the blending requirements. The
price of each kind of oil varies over the six-month period. The two
categories of oil cannot be refined on the same production line. </p>
<p class="p">There is a limit on how much oil of each category (vegetable
or non vegetable) can be refined in a given month:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Not more than 200 tons of vegetable
oil can be refined per month.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Not more than 250 tons of non vegetable
oil can be refined per month.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are constraints on the blending of oils:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The product cannot blend more than three
oils.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">When a given type of oil is blended
into the product, at least 20 tons of that type must be used.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If either vegetable oil 1 (v1) or vegetable
oil 2 (v2) is blended in the product, then non vegetable oil 3 (o3)
must also be blended in that product.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The final product (refined and blended) sells for a known
price: 150 monetary units per ton.</p>
<p class="p">The aim of the six-month plan is to minimize production
and storage costs while maximizing profit.</p>
