The Knight's Tour, is a mathematical problem involving a knight on
a chessboard. The knight is placed on the empty board and, moving
according to the rules of chess, must visit each square exactly once.
There are several billion solutions to the problem, of which about
122,000,000 have the knight finishing on a square from which it attacks
the starting square. Such a tour is described as <em class="ph i">closed</em>.
Otherwise the tour is described as <em class="ph i">open</em>. In Euler’s
version of the problem, the knight must end up in its original position. </p>

supports only integer decision variables. However, it is possible
to constrain floating point expressions, or to use them as an objective
term. It is also possible to declare floating point expressions with
the <samp class="ph codeph">dexpr</samp> keyword.</p>

to access an array with one (or several) of its indexes that is a
decision variable index. The example that uses this element constraint
is a quadratic assignment problem. This is an example of combinatorial
optimization based on a standard problem in location theory. You are
given a set of <samp class="ph codeph">n</samp> products and <samp class="ph codeph">n</samp> sites,
and are told to assign each product to a site. You have <samp class="ph codeph">size</samp> products
to build in <samp class="ph codeph">size</samp> sites, and <samp class="ph codeph">perm</samp> is
a decision variable. The problem is to find the allocation of product
to production sites that generates the lowest transportation cost.
The transportation costs are dependent upon the distance between each
site, and the required flow of products required as input to a production
site. </p>

<div class="section" id="usroplsamples.uss_opl_cpsamples.1024674__usroplsamples.uss_opl_cpsamples.1026862"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The talent problem</h2><p class="p">This problem consists of planning
a movie production. A set of scenes have to be filmed in which various
actors play their parts. The planning consists of deciding in which
slot a scene is to be filmed.</p>
<p class="p">The data consist of the
scenes to be filmed, the actors, and which actor participates in which
scenes. In addition, the actors represent a cost, because they are
paid from the first to the last slot of the scenes that they appear
in. The objective is to minimize the idle cost of the actors.</p>
<p class="p">The model uses a dual representation of the problem. An array
is used to represent which slot is planned for each scene, and another
array represents the scene planned for each slot. The two arrays are
linked using an <samp class="ph codeph">inverse</samp> constraint. Then
all the other problem elements are easily written as expressions of
these decision variables.</p>
