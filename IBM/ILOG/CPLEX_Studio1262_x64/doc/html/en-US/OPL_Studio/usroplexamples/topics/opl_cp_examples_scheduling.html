MMRCPSP problem is a generalization of the Resource-Constrained Project
Scheduling problem. In the MMRCPSP, each activity can be performed
in one out of several modes. Each mode of an activity represents an
alternative way of combining different levels of resource requirements
with a related duration. Renewable and no-renewable resources are
distinguished. While renewable resources have a limited instantaneous
availability such as manpower and machines, non renewable resources
are limited for the entire project, allowing to model, e.g., a budget
for the project.</p>

to be processed on a given set of machines. Each operation has a specific
processing time during which it may not be interrupted. Operations
are grouped in jobs, so that each operation belongs to exactly one
job. Furthermore, each operation requires exactly one machine for
processing.</p>
<p class="p">The objective of the problem is to schedule all
operations, i.e., to determine their start time, so as to minimize
the maximum completion time (makespan) given the additional constraints
that: operations which belong to the same job and operations which
use the same machine cannot be processed simultaneously.</p>
