sequencing problem</h2><p class="p">In this problem, a car assembly line
is set up to build cars on a production line divided into cells. There
are five cells that install options on the cars, requiring different
times to perform the operation for each cell, defined as the number
of cars they can process in a period of time. There are seven different
cars, each requiring a different set of options.</p>
<p class="p">The production
plan specifies the quantity of each car to build. The objective of
the model is to compute a sequence of cars that the cells can process
while minimizing the number of empty cars to insert to respect the
load of the cells.</p>

problem</h2><p class="p">This problem introduces the idea of
using constraints to eliminate symmetries and contains some interesting
modeling issues. It also illustrates structures, arrays indexed by
variables, and logical connectives. The problem consists of plugging
a set of electronic cards into racks with electric connectors. Each
card is characterized by the power it requires, while each rack model
is characterized by the maximal power it can supply, its number of
connectors, and its price. Each card plugged into a rack uses a connector.
The purpose of the model is to find an allocation of a given set of
cards into the available racks.</p>

problem</h2><p class="p">This problem involves finding a schedule
for a sports league. The league has 10 teams that play games over
a season of 18 weeks. Each team has a home arena and plays each other
team twice during the season, once in its home arena and once in the
opposing team’s home arena. For each of these games, the team playing
at its home arena is referred to as the <em class="ph i">home team</em>; the team
playing at the opponent’s arena is called the <em class="ph i">away team</em>. There
are 90 games altogether.</p>
<p class="p">Each of the 18 weeks in the season
has five identical slots to which games can be assigned. Each team
plays once a week. For each pair of teams, these two teams are opponents
twice in a season, and these two games must be scheduled in different
halves of the season. Moreover, these two games must be scheduled
at least six weeks apart. A team must play at home either the first
week of the season or last week of the season but not both.</p>
<p class="p">A <em class="ph i">break</em> is
a sequence of consecutive weeks in which a team plays its games either
all at home or all away. No team can have a break of three or more
weeks. The objective of this problem is to minimize the total number
of breaks.</p>
