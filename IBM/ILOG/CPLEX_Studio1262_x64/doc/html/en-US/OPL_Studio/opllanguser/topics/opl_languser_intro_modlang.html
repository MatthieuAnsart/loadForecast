<p class="p">Modeling languages were created to simplify
the solving of mathematical programming problems. The fundamental
insight underlying traditional modeling languages is the recognition
that many mathematical programming problems can be expressed in a
computer language whose syntax is close to the standard presentation
of these problems in textbooks and scientific papers. These languages
typically provide a number of data types such as arrays and sets,
as well as computer-language equivalents to traditional algebraic
notations.</p>

<p class="p"> </p>
<p class="p">For instance, in AMPL, an expression such as</p>
<div class="image"><img class="image" src="../images/sum.jpg" alt="sum.png" /></div><p class="p">can be written as </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>sum {i in 1..n} a[i] * x[i]</code></pre>
<p class="p">In addition, some of these languages provide a clean
separation between the model and the instance data. </p>
<p class="p">Finally, they are sometimes extended by a command language
that makes it possible to solve sequences of related models and to
make modifications to the models and solve the modified models. Traditional
modeling languages have many benefits that make them appealing for
stating and solving mathematical programming problems. Perhaps their
most significant contribution is to provide a language that directly
supports the natural statement of these problems. This language abstracts
away the implementation details of the underlying solver and users
are then relieved of mundane, low-level, considerations and can focus
on the modeling of their applications. Also important is the clear
separation between the model and the instance data, which ensures
that the same model can be applied to many instances without inducing
additional work. Note that, in these languages, the solver is a black
box that can only be accessed through a set of well-defined parameters. </p>
<p class="p">Traditional modeling languages are particularly strong
in mathematical programming applications, e.g., linear and integer
programming. This is not surprising since this is the area from where
they emerged. In addition, these problems are naturally expressed
using traditional algebraic notations and effective solvers are available
to solve the resulting models.</p>
