<p class="p">This is a classic transportation problem with the addition
of a capacity constraint on the inter-cities connections. The model
is, of course, not appropriate for large-scale transportation problems,
where only a fraction of the cities are connected and a fraction of
the products are sent along the connections. This section discusses
how to exploit the sparsity of large-scale problems. OPL offers more
support than other modeling languages in this respect, because it
can use tuples and arrays indexed by arbitrary finite sets. The methodology
for exploiting sparsity in OPL consists of mirroring, in the model,
the structure of the application. This structure can be inferred from
the objective function and the constraints of the application. For
instance, the capacity constraint for the transportation application
can be phrased as</p>
<p class="p">“The products sent along any given connection may not
exceed the given capacity.”</p>
<p class="p">This constraint helps identify two main concepts in the
application. The first is the connection between two cities, which
can be represented explicitly by a data type </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>tuple connection { string o; string d; }</code></pre>
<p class="p">to manipulate connections as first-class objects. The
second fundamental concept is the transportation of a product along
a connection, called a <em class="ph i">route</em> in this section. Once
again, this concept can be represented explicitly by a data type </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>tuple route { 
  string p; 
  connection e; 
}</code></pre>
<p class="p">to manipulate routes directly. The supply and demand constraints
exhibit two other fundamental concepts: product suppliers (i.e., the
association of a product and a city supplying it) and product consumers
(i.e., the association of a product and a city consuming it). The
data types </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>tuple Supply { string p; string o; }; 
tuple Customer { string p; string d; }; </code></pre>
<p class="p">may be used to represent them. </p>
<p class="p">Once the concepts are identified, an appropriate data
representation can be chosen so that the model can generate constraints
efficiently. Of course, the user data is not necessarily expressed
in this representation, but it is usually easy in OPL to transform
the user data into an appropriate representation.</p>
<p class="p">A good representation for this application consists of
a set of connections, a set of routes, the cost of the routes, and
the demand and supply information. For example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>{route} Routes = ...;
{connection} Connections = { c | &lt;p,c&gt; in Routes };
tuple supply { 
  string p; 
  string o; 
}
{supply} Supplies = { &lt;p,c.o&gt; | &lt;p,c&gt; in Routes };
float Supply[Supplies] = ...;
tuple customer { 
  string p; 
  string d; 
}
{customer} Customers = { &lt;p,c.d&gt; | &lt;p,c&gt; in Routes };
float Demand[Customers] = ...;
float Cost[Routes] = ...;</code></pre>
<p class="p">Note that the connections, suppliers, and customers are
derived automatically from the routes. It is also useful to derive
the following data to simplify the constraint statement: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>{string} Orig[p in Products] = { c.o | &lt;p,c&gt; in Routes };
{string} Dest[p in Products] = { c.d | &lt;p,c&gt; in Routes };

{connection} CPs[p in Products] = { c | &lt;p,c&gt; in Routes };</code></pre>
<p class="p">The objective function and the constraints can now be
stated naturally. The objective function </p>
<p class="p">“minimize the transportation costs along all routes”</p>
<p class="p">is expressed elegantly as </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>minimize
  sum(l in Routes) 
    Cost[l] * Trans[l];</code></pre>
<p class="p">The supply constraint, which can be phrased as </p>
<p class="p">“for every product and every city shipping the product,
the summation of all transportations from that city to a city where
the product is in demand is equal to the supply of the product at
the supplying city”</p>
<p class="p">is formalized by </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  forall( p in Products , o in Orig[p] ) 
    ctSupply[p][o]: 
      sum( &lt;o,d&gt; in CP[p] ) 
        Trans[&lt; p,&lt;o,d&gt; &gt;] == Supply[&lt;p,o&gt;];</code></pre>
<p class="p">The demand constraints are stated in a similar way. The
capacity constraints are stated elegantly as </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  forall(c in Connections)
    ctCapacity:             
      sum( &lt;p,c&gt; in Routes ) 
        Trans[&lt;p,c&gt;] &lt;= Capacity;</code></pre>
<p class="p">This statement is efficient, since OPL retrieves the product
from the routes in an efficient way when the connection is known.

<p class="p">Assume now that part of the user data is given by a relational
table that contains tuples of the form <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;o,d,p,c&gt;</samp> indicating
that a connection between cities <samp class="ph codeph">o</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">d</samp> transports product <samp class="ph codeph">p</samp> at
cost <samp class="ph codeph">c</samp>. This data can be transformed into

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>{Route} Routes = { &lt; &lt;o,d&gt;,p&gt; | &lt;p,o,d,c&gt; in TableRoutes }; </code></pre>
<p class="p">and the costs as </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>float Cost[Routes] = [ &lt;t.p,&lt;t.o,t.d&gt;&gt;:t.cost | t in TableRoutes ];</code></pre>
<p class="p">Both preprocessing instructions are linear in the size
of the table. </p>
