</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The CP Optimizer engine can currently solve any model
than can be solved by the CPLEX engine, provided that all the decision
variables are discrete. This means that any modeling object (constraint
or expressions) in OPL can be interpreted by this engine. The reverse
is not true: some of the new global expressions and constraints can
be used only in a CP model to be solved with the CP Optimizer engine.</p>

<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="usropllangtut.uss_langtut_shortTour.1078042"><h2 class="title topictitle2">The solving engine</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="p">By default (that is, if nothing different is specified),
OPL uses the CPLEX engine to solve an OPL model. To specify that you
want your model to be solved by the CP Optimizer engine, you must
start the model with this statement:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>using CP;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="usropllangtut.uss_langtut_shortTour.1078048"><h2 class="title topictitle2">The OPL model</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="p">You do not need to learn any new syntax to develop a
CP model. The organization of an OPL model for CP does not change.
You define and manipulate data and decision variables in the same
way. For example, to define an array of integer decision variables
indexed by integers from <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">nbOrders</samp> and
taking values between <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">nbSlabs</samp>,
you can write:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>dvar int where[1..nbOrders] in 1..nbSlabs;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="usropllangtut.uss_langtut_shortTour.1078058"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Modeling constraints and specialized constraints</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="p">As for any OPL model, constraints are stated in a <samp class="ph codeph">constraints
{}</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">subject to {}</samp> block.
When the model is solved by the CP Optimizer engine, you can include
some specialized constraints in this set of modeling constraints.
For example, in the steel mill example, there is a packing constraint.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>subject to {  
  packCt: pack(load, where, weight);</code></pre>
<p class="p">This <samp class="ph codeph">pack</samp> constraint is a
simple but powerful one-dimensional packing constraint. It constrains
the way coils are associated with slabs with respect to the weights
of the coils and the capacity of the slabs. More precisely, the decision
variable <samp class="ph codeph">where[i]</samp> states with which slab
coil <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> is to be associated. The decision
variable <samp class="ph codeph">load[j]</samp> represents the total weight
of all the coils associated with slab <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp>,
using the values from the array weights as data. In this case, the
loads are constrained by the maximum value of <samp class="ph codeph">maxLoad</samp> which
is used as upper bound to create the load variables.</p>
<div class="section" id="usropllangtut.uss_langtut_shortTour.1078058__usropllangtut.uss_langtut_shortTour.1078068"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">The "all" syntax</h3><p class="p">In the steel mill example, the arrays of values and decision
variables used in the specialized constraint are modeling arrays.
They make sense as a whole and have been named in the model. Sometimes,
you will want to apply a specialized constraint to a set of variables
that is not defined as a named array of variables, but that is made
of dynamically collected variables. The <samp class="ph codeph">all</samp> keyword
is the syntax that enables you to collect variables dynamically in
an array. This syntax is important for CP models. It is not illustrated
in the steel mill example. See <a class="xref" href="../../opllang_quickref/topics/tlr_opl_all.html" title="OPL keyword that allows you to use only part of an array with functions that take array parameters.">all</a> in the <em class="ph i">Language
Quick Reference</em> for a complete description.</p>

<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="usropllangtut.uss_langtut_shortTour.1078071"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Aggregate and/or</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="p">The other constraint of the model illustrates how to
use the aggregate <samp class="ph codeph">or</samp> constraint.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  forall(s in 1..nbSlabs)
    colorCt: sum (c in 1..nbColors) (or(o in 1..nbOrders : colors[o] == c) (where[o] == s)) &lt;= 2; </code></pre>
<p class="p">You use this constraint just as the usual <samp class="ph codeph">forall</samp> constraint
or <samp class="ph codeph">sum</samp> expression. The <samp class="ph codeph">or</samp> constraint
can express a complex combination of constraints in one single statement.
As a result of the expressiveness of the OPL language, the steel mill
model uses only two OPL constraints to represent a very complete and
realistic model.</p>
