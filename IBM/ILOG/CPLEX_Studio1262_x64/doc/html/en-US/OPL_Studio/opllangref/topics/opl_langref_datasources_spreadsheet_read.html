<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains how to read from a spreadsheet from within OPL.</p>
<p class="p">In OPL, spreadsheet ranges can be read into one- or two-dimensional
arrays or sets. For instance, the instructions:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>/* .mod file */
{string} Gasolines = ...;

tuple GasType {
   float demand;
   float price;
   float octane;
   float lead;
}

GasType gas[Gasolines] = ...;

/* .dat file */
SheetConnection sheet("oilSheet.xls");

Gasolines from SheetRead(sheet,"'gas data'!A2:A4");
Gas from SheetRead(sheet,"'gas data'!B2:E4");</code></pre>
<div class="section" id="usropllangref.uss_langref_datasources.1056122__section1327067635507"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What data can be read from
an Excel spreadsheet?</h2><p class="p">OPL opens a spreadsheet in read-only
mode to read data from it.</p>
<p class="p">The
types of data elements supported are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">sets with integers, floats, strings, or tuples;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">scalar integers, floats, or strings;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">arrays with integers, floats, one- or two-dimensional strings,
or one-dimensional tuples;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">one- or two-dimensional arrays of simple types: for such arrays,
the data must be formatted, that is, it must have the same width/length
as the array to be filled. OPL automatically determines whether the
data must be read line by line or column by column. When facing a
square zone (a two-dimensional array with <samp class="ph codeph">[x][x]</samp> as
dimensions), the engine reads the data line by line.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Only tuples with integer, float, and string components are
supported.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If the sheet name contains a space, the name should be surrounded
by single quotes in the <samp class="ph codeph">SheetRead</samp> instruction. For
example:</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">Oil from SheetRead(sheet,"'oil data'!B2:E4");</samp></p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">OPL does not support the R1C1 reference style to specify the
range when reading data from an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="usropllangref.uss_langref_datasources.1056122__section1238607125434"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accessing named ranges in
Excel</h2><p class="p">IBM ILOG OPL supports the convention
of <em class="ph i">names</em>, which are a word or string of characters used to
represent a cell, range of cells, formula, or constant value, and
that can be used in other formulas.</p>
<p class="p">Thus you can use easy-to-understand
names, such as <samp class="ph codeph">Nutrients</samp>, to refer to hard-to-understand
ranges, such as <samp class="ph codeph">B4:J15</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">IncreasedProtein</samp> to
refer to a constraint. You can then substitute these names in formulas
for the range of cells or constraint.</p>
<p class="p">Excel <em class="ph i">names</em>, or
named ranges, can be accessed using the <samp class="ph codeph">SheetRead</samp> command,
using the following syntax:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>SheetConnection sheetData("C:\\ILOG_Files\\myExcelFile.xls");
prods from SheetRead(sheetData,"Product"); </code></pre>
<p class="p">Note the
double separator \\ in the <samp class="ph codeph">SheetConnection</samp> command.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">SheetRead</samp> command
is normal, and in this example the Excel name <samp class="ph codeph">Product</samp> replaces
the normal syntax of, say, <samp class="ph codeph">C13:O72</samp>. </p>
<p class="p listtitle">To create named ranges in Excel 2007:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">Highlight the range of cells you want to name, then click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Name</span> box
at the left end of the Formula Bar.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Type the name you want to assign to this range and press <span class="ph uicontrol">Enter</span>.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Save the spreadsheet file.</p>
 </li>
</ol>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For
a list of supported versions of Microsoft Excel, please see the detailed
system requirements <a class="xref" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019100" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019100</a>.</div>
<p class="p listtitle">Additional information on named ranges</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Excel automatically updates (expands) a named range when a
row is added somewhere within the range. However, one must careful
adding rows at the end of a range as the range does not get automatically
updated in that case. It would have to be updated manually.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">OPL allows blank rows in a named range. If you are reading
a set of strings, it will consider the blank cells as having the value <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp>.
 If you are reading a set of strings, then it inserts an empty string <samp class="ph codeph">""</samp> into
the set. For example:</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">s2 =  {"Monday" "" "Wednesday"
"Thursday" "Friday"}</samp></p>
 <p class="p">This behavior is the same when
you don't use named range but instead use explicit ranges like <samp class="ph codeph">C1:C5</samp>,
where <samp class="ph codeph">C2</samp> is empty.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">With the Excel VBA one can name the first (top left) cell of
a named range and access the whole range. OPL does not support this.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">When using <samp class="ph codeph">sheetWrite</samp> to write to named ranges,
the size of the range does not have to match the size of the data
you are writing to Excel. If the set is smaller, then only the top
most cells will be filled. </p>
<p class="p">If you try to write more data than
the range can accommodate, you receive the error message: "<samp class="ph codeph">Exception
from IBM ILOG Concert: excel: range is not wide enough to write the
set</samp>". </p>
 <p class="p">In this sense, named ranges behave in exactly
the same way as "regular" ranges.</p>

<div class="section" id="usropllangref.uss_langref_datasources.1056122__usropllangref.uss_langref_datasources.1058636"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Format
of the Excel data</h2><p class="p">Here
we must differentiate between simple types and tuples:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Sets of simple types: The engine reads data from left to right
and top to bottom. Data can therefore be read either horizontally,
vertically, or from a rectangular zone.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Sets of tuples: The data has to be formatted because the tuple
schema has an arity. As in databases and manual tables, the data format
is “fixed width, variable length”. Therefore, tuple sets
are read only line by line in Excel: this is the same representation
as in pure data files.</p>
