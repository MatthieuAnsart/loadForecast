<h1 class="title topictitle1">Introduction</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><div class="abstract"><span class="shortdesc">OPL and CP Optimizer introduce
a set of modeling features for applications that deal with scheduling
over time.</span>
 </div>
<p class="p">In OPL and CP Optimizer, time points are represented as
integers, but the possible very wide range of time points means that
time is effectively continuous. A consequence of scheduling over effectively
continuous time is that the evolution of some known quantities over
time (for instance the instantaneous efficiency/speed of a resource
or the earliness/tardiness cost for finishing an activity at a given
date <em class="ph i">t</em>) needs to be compactly represented in the model.
To that end, CP Optimizer provides the notion of <em class="ph i">piecewise
linear</em> and <em class="ph i">stepwise</em> functions.</p>
<p class="p">Most scheduling applications consist in scheduling in
time some activities, tasks or operations that have a start and an
end time. In CP Optimizer, this type of decision variable is captured
by the notion of the <em class="ph i">interval</em> <em class="ph i">variable</em>.
Several types of constraints are expressed on and between interval
variables:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">to limit the possible positions of an interval
variable (forbidden start/end or “extent” values)</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">to specify precedence relations between two
interval variables</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">to relate the position of an interval variable
with one of a set of interval variables (spanning, synchronization,
alternative).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An important characteristic of scheduling problems is
that time intervals may be optional, and whether to execute a time-interval
or not is a possible decision variable. In CP Optimizer, this is captured
by the notion of a boolean <em class="ph i">presence</em> status associated
with each interval variable. Logical relations can be expressed between
the presence of interval variables, for example to state that whenever
interval <em class="ph i">a</em> is present then interval <em class="ph i">b</em> must
also be present.</p>
<p class="p">Another aspect of scheduling is the allocation of scarce
resources to time intervals. The evolution of a resource over time
can be modelled by two types of variables:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The evolution of a disjunctive resource over
time can be described by the sequence of intervals that represent
the activities executing on the resource. For that, CP Optimizer introduces
the notion of an <em class="ph i">interval</em> <em class="ph i">sequence</em> <em class="ph i">variable</em>. Constraints and expressions are available to
control the sequencing of a set of interval variables.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The evolution of a cumulative resource often
needs a description of how the accumulated usage of the resource evolves
over time. For that purpose, CP Optimizer provides the concept of
the <em class="ph i">cumul</em>ative <em class="ph i">function</em> <em class="ph i">expression</em> that
can be used to constrain the evolution of the resource usage over
time.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The evolution of a resource of infinite capacity,
the state of which can vary over time, is captured in CP Optimizer
by the notion of the <em class="ph i">state</em> <em class="ph i">function</em>.
The dynamic evolution of a state function can be controlled with the
notion of transition distance, and constraints are available for specifying
conditions on the state function that must be satisfied during fixed
or variable intervals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Some classical cost functions in scheduling are earliness/tardiness
costs, makespan, and activity execution or non-execution costs. CP
Optimizer generalizes these classical cost functions and provides
a set of basic expressions that can be combined together; this allows
you to express a large spectrum of scheduling cost functions that
can be efficiently exploited by the CP Optimizer search.</p>
