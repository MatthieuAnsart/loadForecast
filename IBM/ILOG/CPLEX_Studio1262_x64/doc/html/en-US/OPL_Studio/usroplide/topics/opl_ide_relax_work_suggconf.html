<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains the conflict in the model and how to avoid it.</p>
<p class="p">When a model is proved infeasible, OPL also searches
for possible conflicts between the constraints of the model. A conflict
is a set of constraints that cannot be all true at the same time.
At least one of them must be removed or modified to avoid the conflict.
See <a class="xref" href="opl_ide_relax_how.html" title="Relaxations and conflicts both express the infeasibility of a model and propose steps towards feasibility. After you have had hands-on experience with the nurse scheduling example, learn how to differentiate between Relaxations and Conflicts.">How relaxation and conflict search works</a> for
more information.</p>
<p class="p">Return to the <strong class="ph b">Conflicts</strong> tab
if necessary. For the nurses example, the IDE displays the proposed
conflict in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Conflicts</span> tab.</p>
<p class="p">The conflict is that Anne cannot be assigned simultaneously
to both the Emergency and the Consultation shifts. In other words,
to avoid this particular conflict, one of the required shifts (that
is, one of the constraints on assignments to shifts) <strong class="ph b">must</strong> be removed. If no other conflicts
exist in the model, the model then becomes feasible.</p>
