<h1 class="title topictitle1">Relaxations</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A relaxation is a sufficient minimal change, to make
a model feasible.</p>
<p class="p">In this context, a relaxation is a modified model where
some bounds (of variables and/or constraints) have been made wider
than in the first version. For example, an integer variable with the
original bound <samp class="ph codeph">[0,100]</samp> could be relaxed
to <samp class="ph codeph">[0,200]</samp>, or a range constraint <samp class="ph codeph">expr &lt;=
10</samp> could be relaxed to <samp class="ph codeph">expr &lt;= 12</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">The relaxation search process looks for a way to make
the model and its data more flexible so that the problem becomes feasible
while keeping modifications to a minimum. In other words, the suggested
relaxation in the <strong class="ph b">Relaxations</strong> tab
is a <strong class="ph b">sufficient minimal change</strong> to
make the model feasible.</p>
<p class="p">When you use the method <samp class="ph codeph">relaxationIterator.attach</samp>,
you quit the default relaxation level, so all relaxation preferences
have to be stated explicitly, for both constraints and decision variables.
The <samp class="ph codeph">attach</samp> function allows you to set the
relaxation preference for constraints and decision variables (first
argument: single constraint or array of constraints). The preference
is a numerical scalar or array (depending on the first argument),
and, in the case of an array, has the same size as the array in the
first argument. For details of the <samp class="ph codeph">attach</samp> function,
see <samp class="ph codeph">IloOplRelaxationIterator</samp>, in the Reference
Manuals for C++, Java, C#, and ILOG Script.</p>
<div class="section" id="usroplide.uss_ide_relaxation.139443__usroplide.uss_ide_relaxation.142279"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">More about constraint relaxation</h2><p class="p">More specifically, only constraints that have been labeled
are taken into account for possible relaxation and conflicts. As variables
are systematically named, they are always considered by the search
process. Constraints, however, may be unlabeled. If you choose not
to label the constraints in your model, they will not be taken into
account for relaxation or conflict search. In this case, only the
variables will be affected by the relaxation process, which may lead
to surprising suggestions. Moreover, some existing conflicts may not
be found. This is another reason why labeling constraints is a recommended
practice (see <a class="xref" href="../../opllangref/topics/opl_langref_constraints_labels.html" title="Explains why label constraints, the benefits, costs, and limitations, how to label constraints, how to use indexed labels, and how to deal with compatibility between constraint names and labels.">Constraint labels</a> in the <em class="ph i">Language Reference Manual</em>).</p>
