<h1 class="title topictitle1">Examining the engine log</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the contents of the CP engine log displayed in
the CPLEX Studio IDE.</p>
<p class="p">When you click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Engine Log</span> tab in the
Output window, you can see the CP Optimizer log.</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="usroplide.uss_ide_running_cp.1021991__usroplide.uss_ide_running_cp.1022001"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Engine Log for
the Steel Mill example (default CP settings)</span><div class="image"><img class="image" src="../images/steelmill_enginelog2.jpg" alt="Engine log for the steel mill example" /></div></div>
<p class="p">The first line of the log indicates the type of problem, along
with the number of decision variables and constraints in the model.
In the steel mill example, there is an objective included in the model,
so the problem is reported to be a Minimization problem. When the
model does not include an objective, the problem type is reported
as a Satisfiability problem.</p>
<p class="p">In this example, we have one line each 50 branches as indicated
by the parameter set in the model <samp class="ph codeph">steelmill.mod</samp>.</p>
<pre class="pre msgblock"><code>cp.param.LogPeriod = 50;</code></pre>
<p class="p">The next three lines of the log provide information regarding the
initial constraint propagation. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Initial process time</strong> is the time in seconds spent at
the root node of the search tree where the initial propagation occurs.
This time encompasses the time used by the optimizer to load the model,
called extraction, and the time spent in initial propagation.</p>
<p class="p">The value for <strong class="ph b">Log search space</strong> provides an estimate of the
size of the depth-first search tree;  this value is the log (base
2) of the products of the domains sizes of all the decision variables
of the problem. Typically, the estimate of the size of the search
tree should be smaller after the initial propagation, as choices will
have been eliminated. However, this value is always an overestimate
of the log of the number of remaining leaf nodes of the tree because
it does not take into account the action of propagation of constraints
at each node. See the <a class="xref" href="../../glossary/glossary.html#glossary">Glossary</a> for
a definition of search space.</p>
<p class="p">The memory used by the optimizer during the initial propagation
is reported.  Also, any parameter change from its default is displayed
at the head of the search log.</p>
<p class="p">In order to interpret the remainder of the log file, you may want
to think about the search as a binary tree.  The root of the tree
is the starting point in the search for a solution; each branch descending
from the root  represents an alternative choice or decision in the
search. Each of these branches leads to a node where  constraint propagation
during search will occur. If the branch does not lead to a failure
and a solution is not found at a node, the node is called a choice
point. The optimizer can make an additional decision and create two
new alternative branches from the current node, or it can jump in
the tree and search from another node.</p>
<p class="p">The lines in the next section of the progress log, are displayed
periodically during the search and describe the state of the search.
The display frequency of the progress log can be controlled with parameters
of the optimizer. See <a class="xref" href="opl_ide_stats_CP_change.html" title="Explains how to change a constraint programming option in the IDE.">Changing a CP parameter value</a>.</p>
<p class="p">The progress information given in a progress log update includes:</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Branches</strong>: the number of branches explored in the binary
search tree.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Non-fixed</strong>: the number of uninstantiated (not fixed) model
variables.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Branch decision</strong>: the decision made at the branch currently
under consideration by the optimizer</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Best</strong>: the value of the best solution found so far, in the
case of an optimization problem.</p>
<p class="p">The final lines of the log provide information about the entire
search, after the search has terminated. This information about the
search includes:</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Solution status</strong>: the conditions under which the search terminated.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Number of branches</strong>: the number of branches explored in the
binary search tree.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Number of fails</strong>: the number of branches that did not lead
to a solution.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Total memory usage</strong>: the memory used by IBM ILOG Concert
Technology and the IBM ILOG CP Optimizer engine</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Time spent in solve</strong>: the time from start to end of the search,
displayed in seconds. This is system time and not wall-clock time.
(CP Optimizer reports system time by default; however, the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">TimeMode</samp> allows
you to select elapsed (wall-clock) time if you prefer.)</p>
<p class="p"></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Search speed</strong>: average time spent per branch.</p>
<p class="p">The CP Engine Log enables you to trace the propagation (see <a class="xref" href="opl_ide_stats_CP_change.html" title="Explains how to change a constraint programming option in the IDE.">Changing a CP parameter value</a>).</p>
