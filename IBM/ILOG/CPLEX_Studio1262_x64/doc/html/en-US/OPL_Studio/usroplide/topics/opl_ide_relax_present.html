Started with the IDE</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="usroplide.uss_ide_relaxation.143943__usroplide.uss_ide_relaxation.135549"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The nurses example</h2><p class="p">The nurses example describes a nurse scheduling problem:
the hospital Human Resources department needs to create work schedules
for nurses and nurse teams. A good schedule is an optimal one, that
is, a schedule that meets as many of the hospital's overall goals
as possible. If some of these goals prove incompatible, then the solution
consists in nevertheless finding a schedule that will work out, in
other words, a <em class="ph i">feasible</em> schedule. The goals include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">staffing each hospital department with the
proper number of nurses at all times</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">matching a nurse's skills, such as a Board
Certification in Cardiac Care, with the requirements of the department</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">establishing a minimum and maximum number
of hours worked per week.</p>
<p class="p">Maximizing fairness in how
nurses are allocated to shifts, that is, making sure that no nurses
are scheduled for 50 hours a week when others are scheduled for only
25 hours.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">incorporating best practice guidelines, such
as trying to schedule nurses with compatible skills or with a proven
history of working well together on the same team</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">taking into account individual nurse preferences
for days off as much as possible</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">keeping salary costs to a reasonable level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Sometimes, several of these goals will conflict,
for example, during a week when many nurses are on vacation. In such
a case, the solving engine finds no solution. As this is not acceptable
because a hospital needs a nurse schedule, you have to make choices,
prioritize the goals, and relax some constraints accordingly. You
will see in this tutorial how the IDE guides you through this task.</p>
