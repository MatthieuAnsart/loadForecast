<h1 class="title topictitle1">Support for fine-grained scheduling</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Provides an overview of the new scheduling features in
OPL 6.x.</p>
<p class="p">With OPL 6.x, fine-grained scheduling support is being
reintroduced into OPL. This scheduling support differs from OPL 3.7
in both modeling and solving. The aspects of the modeling language
dedicated to fine-grained scheduling have been simplified and made
more uniform and cohesive. The goals of this effort are: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">to make the modeling language easier
to learn and remember, and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">to facilitate the modeling of problems
where execution alternatives or optional activities are present.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The process of solving these fine-grained scheduling
problems follows the "automatic search" paradigm of CP Optimizer,
where a powerful automatic search process solves the problem, reducing
or obviating the need to code search procedures, as was the case in
OPL 3.7.  High-level parameters allow aspects of the search engine
to be controlled.</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">Modeling</p>
<p class="p">Two sections are provided in the OPL 6.x documentation
that describe how to model fine-grained scheduling problems in OPL:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The tutorial <a class="xref" href="../../scheduling_gs/topics/opl_gs_scheduling.html" title="With IBM ILOG CPLEX Studio you can develop scheduling models and solve them using the IBM ILOG CP Optimizer engine. This section of the documentation provides a series of tutorials on how to use the scheduling features of CP Optimizer in CPLEX Studio.">Getting Started with Scheduling in CPLEX Studio</a> describes how to build up a model piece by
piece.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="../../opllangref/topics/opl_langref_scheduling.html" title="Describes how to model scheduling problems in OPL.">Scheduling</a> section in the <em class="ph i">Language Reference Manual</em> is more technical in
nature, giving formal semantics for each language construct. The main
aspects of the language are <em class="ph i">interval
variables</em> (time periods over which some operations
occur), <em class="ph i">functions</em> (piecewise linear and step-based), <em class="ph i">binary ordering constraints</em> (precedences), <em class="ph i">sequence variables</em> (to represent
successor and predecessor relations), and <em class="ph i">function expressions</em> (which represent the usage
of a resource over time).</p>
<p class="p">These concepts
are introduced progressively in the <em class="ph i">Getting Started with Scheduling</em> tutorial. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The following models of some classic scheduling problems,
not mentioned in <em class="ph i">Getting Started with
Scheduling</em>, are also supplied:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="ph filepath">sched_jobshop</span>: Job-Shop Scheduling Problem</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="ph filepath">sched_jobshopflex</span>: Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="ph filepath">sched_flowshop</span>: Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="ph filepath">sched_rcpsp</span>: Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="ph filepath">sched_rcpspmm</span>: Multi-Mode Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An additional extremely important aspect of the language
is that the optionality of an interval variable (and by extension,
the activities carried out over that interval) is a fundamental part
of the language. An important characteristic of scheduling problems
is that activities may be optional and/or there may be alternative
modes of execution. </p>
<p class="p">In the language, this is captured by the notion of a
boolean presence status of each interval. OPL provides constraints
such as <samp class="ph codeph">alternative</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">span</samp> which directly exploit the idea of optional intervals. </p>
<p class="p">These constraints make it considerably easier (compared
to OPL 3.7) to express complex processes involving alternative modes,
alternative recipes or hierarchical problems with work breakdown structures.
 See, for instance, the model for the Multi-Mode Resource-Constrained
Project Scheduling Problem (<span class="ph filepath">sched_rcpspmm</span>).  The automatic search within CP Optimizer decides (according to
cost criteria) which optional interval variables will be present in
the final solution.</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">Search controls</p>
<p class="p">The inference aspects of the parts of the search engine
dedicated to structures found in scheduling can be controlled via
the parameters:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CumulFunctionInferenceLevel</samp></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">IntervalSequenceInferenceLevel</samp></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">NoOverlapInferenceLevel</samp></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">PrecedenceInferenceLevel</samp></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">StateFunctionInferenceLevel</samp></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">with available settings of Low, Basic, Medium, and Extended.
For example, in an <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp> block before
the constraints are specified, you can write:</p>
<div class="p"><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>execute {
  cp.param.NoOverlapInferenceLevel = "Extended";
}</code></pre>
</div>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">Semantic equivalences between OPL 3.7 and OPL 6.x</p>
<p class="p">These notes will help you determine whether you can try
to migrate an existing scheduling application developed in OPL 3.7
to OPL 6.x and if so, the way in which to do it.  If you are not aware
of the differences in "core" CP support between OPL 3.7 and OPL 6.x,
we suggest that you read the OPL <em class="ph i">Release
Notes</em> for those versions before beginning any migration
effort.</p>
<p class="p">The notes here describe equivalent models in OPL 3.7
and OPL 6.x, which should help you to migrate your OPL 3.7 model to
OPL 6.x.</p>
