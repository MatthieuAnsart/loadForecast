<h1 class="title topictitle1">OPL 6.x concepts - project files vs. folders</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">OPL projects are handled differently in OPL 6.x, compared
to previous releases.</p>
<p class="p">There are some important concepts to understand before
importing projects created with previous versions of OPL into the
OPL IDE.</p>
<p class="p listtitle">How projects were defined previous to OPL 6.x:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">OPL 5.x (and previous releases) used
the concept of a <em class="ph i">project</em> to associate a model (<samp class="ph codeph">.mod</samp>) file with
one or more data (<samp class="ph codeph">.dat</samp>) files. From OPL
5.x onwards, there could also be one or more settings (<samp class="ph codeph">.ops</samp>) files, and one or more run configurations. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The relationships between these elements
was maintained by a project (<samp class="ph codeph">.prj</samp>) file. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">project_name.prj</span> file could be double-clicked in Windows Explorer to launch that
project in the OPL IDE.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p listtitle">How projects are defined in OPL 6.x:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">In OPL 6.x, the same project elements
are present and are still referred to as a <em class="ph i">project</em>, but they are stored in named <em class="ph i">folders</em> under a root folder.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">All of the elements of the OPL project
— model files, data files, settings files and run configurations
— must be stored in the same folder or one of its subfolders.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Project (<samp class="ph codeph">.prj</samp>) files no longer exist.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Instead, a <samp class="ph codeph">.project</samp> file stores information specific to the OPL IDE environment, and
an <samp class="ph codeph">.oplproject</samp> file stores information
similar to what was stored in the old <samp class="ph codeph">.prj</samp> files.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Projects created with previous releases
(OPL 3.x, OPL 4.x, and OPL 5.x) must be migrated and converted to
the OPL 6.x format before they can be used.</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Projects created in OPL 5.x can be migrated
directly using the OPL 6.x Import Wizard. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Because of language changes between
versions, projects created in OPL 3.x or OPL 4.x should be re-created
as new projects in OPL 6.x.</p>
