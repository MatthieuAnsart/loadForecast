<h1 class="title topictitle1">Recommended migration paths</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">OPL projects created in previous releases have specific
migrations paths to version 6.x.</p>
<p class="p">There are basically two paths for migrating your existing
OPL projects into OPL 6.x. </p>
<p class="p">Because of changes to the OPL language and/or syntax
and the different ways that projects themselves were structured in
different releases, these paths are dependent on the version used
to create the original projects and the nature of the projects themselves.</p>

<p class="p">The OPL 6.x Import Wizard allows you to easily migrate
your OPL 5.x projects and create the proper folder structure for them
in OPL 6.x.</p>
<p class="p">The Import Wizard also allows you to migrate your OPL-ODM
projects. When you do this, your ODM-specific files, settings, data sources
and, JAR files containing customizations are also migrated and placed
in the same folder. Guidelines have been provided in the following
section to help you with this process:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">One of the features of the Import Wizard is the ability
to <strong class="ph b">merge</strong> OPL projects
as you migrate. That is, if you have separate OPL 5.x projects that
share model, data or settings files, you can import them into the
same folder and treat them not as separate projects but as one project
with multiple run configurations. For technical reasons, this feature
is not possible when importing OPL-ODM projects.</p>
</div>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">Migrating OPL 4.x and 3.x projects</p>
<p class="p">Because of language and product changes between versions,
projects created in OPL 3.x or OPL 4.x <strong class="ph b">should be re-created as new projects in OPL 6.x</strong>.
