<h1 class="title topictitle1">Overview and general migration procedure</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A general discussion of the issues involved when re-creating
your OPL 4.x and 3.x projects in the OPL 6.x IDE.</p>
<p class="p">There have been many changes and improvements in the OPL language
and syntax over the years, some of them so fundamental that it is
not possible to create an Import Wizard that handles all eventualities. </p>
<p class="p">For example, OPL 4.0 introduced a separation between the model
and the data used for that model that was not possible in previous
releases. Similarly, with each release there have been enhancements
to the OPL language; some syntax elements have been deprecated and
others have been newly created.</p>
<p class="p">As a result, we recommend that you migrate the models that you
created in OPL 3.x and 4.x by re-creating them in the OPL 6.x IDE.</p>
<p class="p">These guidelines, plus the more detailed information in the following
sections, will help you when re-creating your projects.</p>
<p class="p listtitle">General procedure for migrating OPL 4.x
and 3.x projects</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">Create a new project in OPL 6.x, using the procedures detailed
in the <a class="xref" href="../../gsoplide/topics/opl_ide_gs_tut_create_proj.html" title="Walks you through creating a project file, adding model and data, and setting mathematical programming options.">Creating a project</a> section

</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Import (or paste) your existing model (<samp class="ph codeph">.mod</samp> into
the OPL editor and, with the assistance of the syntax checker, update
them to comply with OPL 6.x syntax.</p>
<p class="p">The information in the following
sections will help you to pinpoint the things you need to change,
for non-CP models, CP models, and CP Scheduling models.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If your existing project contains a data (<samp class="ph codeph">.dat</samp>)
file, import (or paste) it into the OPL editor and, again with the
assistance of the syntax checker, update it to OPL 6.x levels.</p>
</li>
