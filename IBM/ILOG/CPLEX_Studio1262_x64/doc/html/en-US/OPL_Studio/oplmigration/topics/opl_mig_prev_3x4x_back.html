(MP) optimization based on the ILOG CPLEX solving engine and constraint
programming (CP) based on ILOG Solver and ILOG Scheduler.
The engine (CPLEX or Solver) was chosen automatically, whether the
problem was linear or not. There was a sophisticated language in OPL
3.x with which to write search procedures.</p>

ILOG OPL Development Studio 4.0, the foundation for ILOG Optimization
Decision Management System (ODMS). The main theme for this release
was to turn ILOG OPL Development Studio into a scalable optimization
development tool that can be used for prototyping models, deploying
models in production, and maintaining deployed applications. In this
first step, only the CPLEX solving engine was supported. </p>
<p class="p">Architectural changes introduced some changes into the
language:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Only CPLEX was supported in this release.
Quadratic programming was supported (QP, QCP, MIQP, MIQCP).</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The scripting language used to chain
models or manipulate data in a procedural way, OPL Script, was replaced
by a standard scripting language, JavaScript.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">A better separation between data and
model for all data sources (flat files, Excel files, databases) led
to some changes in the data declaration of a model.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Minor changes were introduced in the
language, such as:</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">struct</samp> was
renamed <samp class="ph codeph">tuple</samp>.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">var</samp> was renamed
to <samp class="ph codeph">dvar</samp> for decision variables, to avoid
a confusion with <samp class="ph codeph">var</samp> for JavaScript variables.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">=</samp> when used
in comparisons, was replaced by <samp class="ph codeph">==</samp>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

ILOG Optimization Decision Manager 2.0 with ILOG OPL Development
Studio 5.0. ILOG Optimization Decision Manager is a specialized
application development tool that helps users build and deploy decision
support applications, putting the power of optimization into the hands
of business people. In that release, ILOG OPL Development Studio also
supported logical constraints as managed by the CPLEX solving engine.</p>

<div class="section" id="descriptiveTopic1204220127500__section1204220281179"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">ILOG OPL Development Studio 5.2 - new CP support</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">May 2007:</strong> ILOG introduced
constraint programming back into OPL Development Studio. The main
theme of this release was to make CP as easy to use as MP by providing
a model and run development process while keeping good performance.
To this end, a tunable default search has been developed. In this
release, only “core constraint programming” was supported:
arithmetic constraints, specialized constraints, and logical constraints
on discrete decision variables. Detailed scheduling, that deals with
time intervals and resources, was not supported yet. </p>
<p class="p">A second wave of changes was introduced, compared to
the OPL 3.x language:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">If you are writing a CP model, you must
start it with the statement</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">using CP;</samp> </p>

<p class="p">If you are writing a CPLEX model, you can declare</p>

<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">using CPLEX;</samp> </p>

<p class="p">but this is not mandatory since by default, OPL considers
that the model uses CPLEX.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">There is no search language. Instead,
the default search can be tuned, when needed, by specifying search
phases.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The set of constraints and their spelling
has slightly evolved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
