<h1 class="title topictitle1">In Java applications</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX Studio needs to locate Java and ICU shared libraries
on Windows and UNIX platforms.</p>
<p class="p">The Java API for OPL is provided as the <span class="ph filepath">oplall.jar</span> file,
located in the <span class="ph filepath">opl\lib</span> directory of CPLEX Studio.
At run time, this <span class="ph filepath">.jar</span> file references other
OPL shared libraries, which may also depend on other libraries. All
OPL shared libraries are, by default, located in a subfolder of the <span class="ph filepath">opl\bin</span> directory
of CPLEX Studio. For example, <samp class="ph codeph">opl\bin\x86_win32</samp> for
the Windows 32-bit port.</p>
<p class="p">For Java applications to correctly invoke OPL objects, the operating
system needs to load these libraries, as well as other dependent libraries.
This is done essentially in the same way for Windows and UNIX machines.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You must use the <samp class="ph codeph">oplall.jar</samp> file that corresponds
to your platform. This <samp class="ph codeph">oplall.jar</samp> file is delivered
with the installer for a given platform and is specific to that platform.</div>
<div class="section" id="oplports.uss_ports_env.1014417__oplports.uss_ports_env.1014476"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">For CPLEX Studio
on Windows</h2><p class="p">CPLEX Studio needs to find one <samp class="ph codeph">.dll</samp> file
for OPL: <span class="ph filepath">opl&lt;version&gt;.dll</span>. The <samp class="ph codeph">PATH</samp> environment
variable must include the directory containing this shared library.
By default, it is located in the <span class="ph filepath">opl\bin\&lt;port&gt;</span> directory
of the distribution.</p>
<p class="p">At run time, this <samp class="ph codeph">opl&lt;version&gt;.dll</samp> file
references other OPL <samp class="ph codeph">.dll</samp> files, which may also depend
on other <samp class="ph codeph">.dll</samp> files.</p>
<p class="p">When CPLEX Optimization
Studio is installed, the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable
Package (x86) must also be installed. This package installs runtime
components of Visual C++ Libraries required to run applications developed
with Visual C++ 2010 SP1 on a computer that does not have Visual C++
2010 SP1 installed. If the installer detects that this package is
not already installed, it explains what you need to do.</p>
<p class="p">There
are dependencies on DLLs in this redistributable package, and you
should bear this in mind if you package shared libraries to be deployed
on a machine where CPLEX Optimization Studio is not installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="oplports.uss_ports_env.1014417__oplports.uss_ports_env.1014477"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">For CPLEX Studio
on UNIX platforms</h2><p class="p">CPLEX Studio needs to find the following
shared libraries: <span class="ph filepath">libopl&lt;version&gt;</span>, <span class="ph filepath">libilog</span>, <span class="ph filepath">libdbkernel</span>, <span class="ph filepath">liblnkdyn</span>,
and the <span class="ph filepath">libcplex&lt;version_number&gt;</span> shared
library.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX Studio also needs to find the ICU libraries <samp class="ph codeph">libicu*.so</samp>.
ICU (International Components for Unicode) is a set of C/C++ and Java
libraries that provide Unicode and Globalization support for CPLEX
Optimization Studio.  ICU is widely portable and gives applications
the same results on all platforms and between C/C++ and Java software.</p>
<p class="p">These
libraries are located, by default, in the <span class="ph filepath">opl/bin</span> directory
of CPLEX Studio. The <samp class="ph codeph">PATH</samp> environment variable for
shared libraries (<samp class="ph codeph">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</samp> on Solaris and
Linux, <samp class="ph codeph">LIBPATH</samp> on AIX) must contain a reference to
the directory holding these libraries.</p>
<p class="p">In general, for programs
that use the Java interface to OPL to run correctly, the <span class="ph filepath">oplall.jar</span> file
must be in the Java classpath, and the necessary shared libraries
in the dynamic library path. Moreover, you must make sure that the <samp class="ph codeph">PATH</samp> environment
variable for dynamic libraries does not reference directories from
other CPLEX Studio installations; this avoids versioning problems.</p>
<p class="p">As
an alternative solution, you can package all the necessary shared
libraries directly with your application, in the same directory as
the application executable. Many operating systems implicitly check
the executable directory without traversing the <samp class="ph codeph">PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH/LIBPATH</samp> environment
variable.</p>
