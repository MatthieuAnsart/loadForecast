<div class="section" id="mkd9DmJK__Overview"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Overview</h2></div>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> For code completion to be active, the code must have been fully
parsed. That is, it must have been error free initially. This is important
when you create a new model that shows errors. The errors must be
eliminated or corrected so that the code can be parsed completely.</div>
<p class="p">Code completion can be invoked at any time in the IDE editor while
creating or editing an OPL model. The code completion feature prompts
you with a context-sensitive list, and enables you to select model
elements from the list and insert them into your model.</p>
<p class="p">Code completion is activated by pressing <span class="ph uicontrol">Ctrl + Space</span>,
or after typing a dot (<strong class="ph b">.</strong>), in the .mod file (modeling or scripting
part).</p>
<p class="p">You can filter elements by typing the first character or characters,
to display a restricted list of elements.</p>
<p class="p">The list of elements proposed is context sensitive, in that code
completion can detect whether you are writing a CPLEX® or CP Optimizer model, and prompt you
only with the relevant code elements. It can detect whether you are
entering OPL modeling code or scripting code, and display an appropriate
list of code elements. It can also detect model elements defined by
the user in the modeling part of the code.</p>
<p class="p">The proposals that follow a dot (<strong class="ph b">.</strong>), depend on what precedes
the dot. For example,</p>
<p class="p">after <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;tuplename&gt;.</samp> the proposals, in a modeling
context, would contain field names defined by the tuple.</p>
<p class="p">In a modeling context (not scripting), the dot syntax applies only
to tuples and tuple sets.</p>
<div class="section" id="mkd9DmJK__WorkingWithCodeCompletion"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Working with code completion</h2><p class="p">The
proposals made by code completion depend on whether you are in the
modeling part of the code, or in the scripting part.</p>
<div class="sectiondiv"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Modeling</strong></p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">In a new line, press <span class="ph uicontrol">Ctrl + Space</span>. The
window opens, displaying entries that are appropriate for the context.
In this example, the code completion was activated in the modeling
part of the code, and OPL keywords and functions are proposed.<div class="image"><img class="image" src="../images/completion_1_ctrl_space.jpg" alt="Code completion popup in the IDE editor" /></div></li>
<li class="li">To filter the display, type one or more characters of the keyword
or function you are searching for, before or after pressing <span class="ph uicontrol">Ctrl
+ Space</span>. For example, here the user types the letter <span class="ph uicontrol">m</span>.<div class="image"><img class="image" src="../images/completion_2_first_letter.jpg" alt="Code completion popup in the IDE editor, after typing a letter." /></div></li>
<li class="li">To insert the selection, double-click it or select it and press <span class="ph uicontrol">Enter</span>.
In this example, the user has selected the <samp class="ph codeph">minimize</samp> keyword,
and it is inserted into the editor at the cursor position.<div class="image"><img class="image" src="../images/completion_4_return.jpg" alt="Selected keyword inserted into the IDE editor" /></div><p class="p">Note that the
red <strong class="ph b">X</strong> symbol appears in the left margin of the editor at this
point, because <samp class="ph codeph">minimize</samp> has required arguments that
have not yet been supplied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Example of dot completion on a tuple, in a modeling context
(not scripting).</p>
<p class="p">Tuple field completion is type aware, so it
shows only valid fields for a given tuple.</p>
<p class="p">The code extract
below shows a simple example of dot completion on a tuple. The dropdown
list is sorted by <samp class="ph codeph">int</samp> since that is what is being
declared (<samp class="ph codeph">int cost =</samp>). If you type a 'c' after the
dot, the list will contain only "cost".</p>
<img class="image" src="../images/ast_code_completion.png" alt="Code completion popup after typing dot (.)" /><p class="p">In this example, f you type 'c'
after the dot, to filter elements beginning with 'c', the line is
completed as <samp class="ph codeph">int cost = t.cost</samp>, because there are
no other relevant possibilities.</p>
</div><div class="sectiondiv"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Scripting</strong></p>
<p class="p">In ILOG® Script, class methods and
properties are presented, sorted alphabetically when yo type a dot
after a scripting element, or when you press <span class="ph uicontrol">Ctrl + Space</span> at
the beginning of a line. In the code extract below, the scripting
keyword <samp class="ph codeph">thisOplModel</samp> is followed by a dot. The class
methods and properties in ILOG Script
are displayed.</p>
<img class="image" src="../images/ast_javascript_with_doc.png" alt="Code completion popup for ILOG Script method, with documentation of the method." /><p class="p">The documentation for the selected ILOG Script method is also displayed.</p>
<p class="p">You
can filter on scripting keywords such as <samp class="ph codeph">Opl</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">thisOplModel</samp>.
In the example below, the user has filtered on 'g' after the dot,
displaying only the functions that begin with 'g'.</p>
