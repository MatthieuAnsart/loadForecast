<div class="body"><p class="p">The active project name is <em class="ph i">the one that is
currently selected in the OPL Projects Navigator</em>. No action is
required to change active projects other than clicking the project
name or any of the files inside the project folder.</p>
<div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span>  <p class="p">This does NOT mean that
clicking in a project and making it the active project causes its
default run configuration to be the active run configuration under
the <span class="ph uicontrol">Run</span> button <img class="image" src="../images/runbuttonb.jpg" alt="Run button" />. By default, when you click the
green arrow in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Run</span> button, you
relaunch the last run configuration solved, in whatever project was
last run.</p>
 <p class="p"> So if you want to launch a run configuration
from the project you have just set as the active project by clicking
in it, use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Run</span> option from the
right-click menu, and select the run configuration you want. After
the first time you do this, the run configuration will be set as the
most recently run, and simply clicking the green arrow of the <span class="ph uicontrol">Run</span> button will relaunch it.</p>

projects that reference the same files. This makes sense, for instance,
if your projects are meant to be eventually deployed in different

<div class="section" id="refoplide.uss_ide_processes.1076417__refoplide.uss_ide_processes.1075528"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">In several run configurations</h3><p class="p">If you plan
to use CPLEX® Studio to write
and test several versions of identical or similar optimization problems,
you should consider creating several run configurations of a single
project rather than one project for each variation. See <a class="xref" href="../../gsoplide/topics/opl_ide_gs_tut_execute_proj.html" title="Walks you through populating and executing the run configuration, creating a different configuration, and understanding project execution.">Executing a project</a> in <em class="ph i">Getting Started with the IDE</em> for details. This can be
the case, for instance, at prototyping stage, for testing and debugging
purposes. Several samples delivered with the CPLEX Studio distribution, such as <samp class="ph codeph">cutstock</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">production</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">sailco</samp>, and others, define more than one run configuration.</p>
