<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A definition of the kind of statements you can write
with IBM ILOG
Script</p>
<p class="p">A script is a sequence of commands. These commands can
be of various types: declarations, simple instructions, and compound
instructions. Both type and data declarations are supported in IBM ILOG Script.</p>
<p class="p">IBM ILOG Script is a language for combining, and interacting
with, OPL models.</p>
<p class="p">It supports OPL models as first-class objects and makes
it possible to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">solve multiple instances of the same
model</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">solve sequences of models where one
model takes as input the results of another model</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">combine both the above, as in column-generation
applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An OPL statement describes a model for an optimization
application. However, there are many applications where model solving
is only a part of a more complex application. These applications may
need to solve a set of closely related models, e.g., to analyze the
impact of the data; they may need to solve a sequence of models, where
the solution of one model is the input data of another model; or they
may need to have two models cooperate in order to converge towards
a solution, as is often the case in column-generation algorithms. </p>
<p class="p">IBM ILOG Script aims at simplifying the design of
such applications. The key insight of IBM ILOG Script is to view
models as first-class objects: an IBM ILOG Script model is an object
that is initialized by an OPL model (and possibly some OPL data files).
This object supports a variety of methods to solve the model, to access
its data, or to change the value of its settings, to name only a few. </p>
<p class="p">In addition, IBM ILOG Script offers the same high-level
data structures as in OPL, embeds them in an imperative language,
and adds some novel constructs that address specific needs of these
applications. </p>
<p class="p">It is important to stress that IBM ILOG Script is orthogonal
to existing tools such as JavaScript. Its main benefit is to offer
dedicated and high-level support for complex optimization applications.
In particular, its rich data modeling facilities and its strong typing
make it fundamentally different from existing script languages. </p>
