Center</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><div class="abstract"><div class="shortdesc">Describes the features and benefits of Decision Optimization Center.</div>

<p class="p">Developing an application with IBM ILOG CPLEX Studio and IBM Decision Optimization Center is very
easy and productive.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The integration comes with a wizard that automatically generates a Decision Optimization Center
application based on the structure of your OPL model.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">OPL data structures such as arrays and tuple sets are mapped to input data tables and graphical
views in Decision Optimization Center. Because they are editable, users can then play out scenarios
in Decision Optimization Center based on data changes.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Mathematical constraints from your OPL model can be exposed as Decision Optimization Center
<em class="ph i">requirements</em> (soft constraints) with priorities, allowing a business user to make trade-offs
between conflicting business requirements and alternative relaxations.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The objectives of your mathematical model are mapped to Decision Optimization Center
<em class="ph i">goals</em>, which allow interactive goal programming and balancing between multiple objective
criteria.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Decision variables in the model are represented as solution views in Decision Optimization
Center, and can be configured to show aggregate values and key performance indicators (KPIs), as
well as providing exporting to Excel and integration with reporting tools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The generated Decision Optimization Center application is configurable through editors inside
CPLEX Studio, and as the model evolves it can be extended to take new business requirements into
account. The following figure shows how a chart view in Decision Optimization Center is configured
in CPLEX Studio.</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="oplquickstart.uss_odmoverview.1013439__oplquickstart.uss_odmoverview.1012882"><div class="image"><img class="image" src="../images/odmoplvieweditor.jpg" alt="The Decision Optimization Center View Editor" /></div></div>
<p class="p">Developing an application with CPLEX Studio and Decision Optimization Center also allows business
users to take part in the rapid prototyping and iterative development needed to strengthen
definitions of requirements, refine models, perfect scenario parameters, and examine KPIs, solution
views, and business goals.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">If you are reading this because you use CPLEX Studio, but without access to Decision Optimization
Center, please contact your IBM sales representative.</p>
