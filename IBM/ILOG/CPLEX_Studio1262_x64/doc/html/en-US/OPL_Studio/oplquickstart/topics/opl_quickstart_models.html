<h1 class="title topictitle1">OPL model files</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><div class="abstract"><div class="shortdesc">Model files contain all your OPL statements. The data
and the objective function are not mandatory and there may be more
optional components, such as scripting statements, in a model file.</div>

<p class="p">Model (<span class="ph filepath">.mod</span>) files
contain all your OPL statements. The data and the objective function
are not mandatory and there may be more optional components, such
as scripting statements. Note that you can also generate a model file
in a compiled form (<span class="ph filepath">.opl</span>) from
the IDE for execution through the OPL interface libraries (see <a class="xref" href="../../refoplide/topics/opl_ideref_proces_output_compil.html" title="Describes how to generate a binary version of a model file.">Generating a compiled model</a>). The components of a model file are covered in the following sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="oplquickstart.uss_fromortoopl.1031251__oplquickstart.uss_fromortoopl.1030999"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Declarations of data</h2><p class="p">Data declarations allow you to name your data items so
that you can reference them easily in your model. For example, if
your data in a table defines the cost of shipping one unit of material
from location <em class="ph i">i</em> to
location <em class="ph i">j</em>, you
might want to call your item of data <em class="ph i">cost</em><sub class="ph sub">ij</sub> where <em class="ph i">i</em>=1, . . . , <em class="ph i">n</em> and <em class="ph i">j</em>=1, . . . , <em class="ph i">n</em> and <em class="ph i">n</em> is the number
of locations in your model. You tell OPL that your model uses this
data by declaring:</p>
<p class="p"> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>int n = . . . ;
float cost[1..n][1..n] = . . . ;</code></pre>
<p class="p"> </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">. . .</strong> (ellipsis) means that the values for your table are located in a
data file, which must be listed in the current project.</p>
<p class="p">You could also list the data explicitly in the model
file. However, it is recommended that you construct model files without
specifying values for data so that you can later easily solve many
instances of the same model by simply changing the data file. See
also <a class="xref" href="opl_quickstart_runconfigs.html" title="Run configurations are a way of handling model, data, and settings files within a project.">Run configurations</a>.</p>
<p class="p">Note that the <samp class="ph codeph">int</samp> type declared
means that the numbers in the data file must be integers. If the numbers
in the data file are floating-point numbers, use the <samp class="ph codeph">float</samp> type instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="oplquickstart.uss_fromortoopl.1031251__oplquickstart.uss_fromortoopl.1033027"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Declarations of decision variables</h2><p class="p">In an OPL context, as opposed to IBM ILOG Script and
to the general programming context, variables are decision variables.
Declarations of decision variables name, and give the type of, each
variable in the model. For example, if you want to create a variable
that equals the amount of material shipped from location <em class="ph i">i</em> to location <em class="ph i">j</em>, you can create a variable named <em class="ph i">ship</em><sub class="ph sub">ij</sub>.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>dvar float+ ship[1..n][1..n];</code></pre>
<p class="p">That statement declares an array of non-negative floating-point
variables. (That is what <samp class="ph codeph">float+</samp> means).
The <samp class="ph codeph">dvar</samp> keyword indicates that you are
declaring a decision variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="oplquickstart.uss_fromortoopl.1031251__oplquickstart.uss_fromortoopl.1033044"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">An objective function</h2><p class="p">The objective function is a function that you want to
optimize. This function must consist of variables and data that you
have declared earlier in the model file. The objective function is
introduced by either the <samp class="ph codeph">minimize</samp> or the <samp class="ph codeph">maximize</samp> keyword. For example,</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>minimize sum(i,j in 1..n) cost[i][j]*ship[i][j];</code></pre>
<p class="p">That statement indicates that you want to minimize the
sum of the shipping costs for each origin-destination pair.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="oplquickstart.uss_fromortoopl.1031251__oplquickstart.uss_fromortoopl.1033081"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Constraints</h2><p class="p">Constraints indicate the conditions necessary for a feasible
solution to your model. You declare constraints within a <samp class="ph codeph">subject to</samp> block. For example,</p>
<p class="p"> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>subject to {
   forall(j in 1..n) sum(i in 1..n) ship[i][j] == demand[j];
}</code></pre>
<p class="p"> </p>
<p class="p">That statement declares one set of constraints. There
is a constraint for each destination. (That is what the <samp class="ph codeph">forall</samp> keyword indicates.) The constraint for each
destination states that the sum of material shipped to that destination
must equal the demand at that destination. The symbol <samp class="ph codeph">==</samp> indicates equals within a constraint block. The
symbol <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;=</samp> indicates less than or equal
to. The symbol <samp class="ph codeph">&gt;=</samp> indicates greater than
or equal to.</p>
