<h1 class="title topictitle1">Two solving engines</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Two solving engines underlie OPL: CPLEX and CP
Optimizer. The CPLEX engine for mathematical programming is used by
default, the CP Optimizer engine for constraint programming is called
if your model requests it.</p>
<p class="p">After the model, data, and settings files are complete,
use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Run</span> button <img class="image" src="../../_shared/images/icon_opl_run_run_configuration.png" alt="Run button" /> or
the menus in the Projects Navigator to run your model.</p>
<p class="p">The time it will take to solve a model naturally depends
on the size and complexity of the model. Typical textbook problems
like the P-Median problem usually solve very quickly. If the solver
finds a feasible solution, it displays the solution in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Solutions</span> tab of the Output Area. (See <a class="xref" href="opl_quickstart_main.html" title="The main window of the CPLEX Studio IDE, and a brief description of its primary controls and elements are presented here.">The Main window</a>.) The solver will
continue working until an optimal solution is found or until you click
the <span class="ph uicontrol">Abort</span> button.</p>
<p class="p">OPL supports two solving engines:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">the CPLEX engine for mathematical programming
is used by default when you run your project, if your model does not
start with the statement <samp class="ph codeph">using CP;</samp>. This
is the case of the P-Median problem described in the <a class="xref" href="opl_quickstart_pmedian.html" title="The P-Median problem is a well known warehouse allocation problem in Operations Research.">Modeling the P-Median problem with OPL</a>.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the CP Optimizer engine for constraint programming
is called if your model starts with the statement <samp class="ph codeph">using
CP;</samp>. You can write, edit and solve the model from the CPLEX
Studio IDE, from the <samp class="ph codeph">oplrun</samp> command line
tool, and from the APIs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">You will find more information on CP modeling and solving
in the documentation set. In particular, <a class="xref" href="../../opllanguser/topics/opl_languser_intro_cp_vs_mp.html" title="Explains why it makes sense to compare CP and MP, and provides details on the salient features of each approach.">Constraint programming versus mathematical programming</a> in the <em class="ph i">Language User’s Manual</em> presents
the differences between MP models and CP models.</p>
