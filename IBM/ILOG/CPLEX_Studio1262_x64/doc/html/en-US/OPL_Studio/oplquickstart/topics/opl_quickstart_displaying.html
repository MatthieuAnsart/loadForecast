both while the solver is running and after the solving has finished.</p>
<p class="p">It is possible for you to view solutions while the solver
is running, as well as after it has finished. In addition to the <span class="ph uicontrol">Solutions</span> tab of the Output Area, you can view
a solution in tabular form through the <span class="ph uicontrol">Problem
Browser</span>. (See <a class="xref" href="opl_quickstart_main.html" title="The main window of the CPLEX Studio IDE, and a brief description of its primary controls and elements are presented here.">The Main window</a>.) If your model
expresses a MIP problem that generates feasible solutions, you can
see the solution pool in the Problem Browser and further populate
it with more nonoptimal solutions. (You can also see feasible solutions
in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Solutions</span> tab if certain
language settings are selected; see <a class="xref" href="../../refoplide/topics/opl_gui_mainwin_pb.html#refoplide.uss_ide_guiref.1010436__section1207236195515">After running a project</a> and <a class="xref" href="../../oplparams/topics/opl_params_langoptions_setting.html" title="How to consult or change OPL language options.">Setting language options</a>.)</p>
<p class="p">You can see variable values in the Problem Browser, which
also contains information about data structures, data values, labeled
constraints and sensitivity data, as well as postprocessing data.</p>
