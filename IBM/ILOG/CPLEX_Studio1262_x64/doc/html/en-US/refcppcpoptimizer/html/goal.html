Goals can be used to control the branch and cut search in <code>
IloCplex</code>
. Goals are implemented in the class <code>
IloCplex::GoalI</code>
. The class <code>
IloCplex::Goal</code>
 is the handle class. That is, it contains a pointer to an instance of <code>
IloCplex::GoalI</code>
along with accessors of objects in the implmenetation class.</p><p>


To implement your own goal, you need to subclass <code>
IloCplex::GoalI</code>
 and implement its virtual member functions <code>execute</code>
 and <code>duplicateGoal</code>. The method <code>execute</code>
 controls the branch &amp; cut search. The method <code>duplicateGoal</code>
 creates a copy of the invoking goal object to be used for 
parallel branch &amp; cut search. Implementing your goal can be greatly 
simplified if you use one  of the macros <code>
ILOCPLEXGOALn</code>.</p><p>

Every branch &amp; cut node maintains a goal stack, possibly containing <code>
IloCplex::GoalI</code>
 objects. After <code>
IloCplex</code>
 solves the relaxation of a node, it pops the top goal 
from the goal stack and calls its method <code>execute</code>. 
There are several types of goals:</p><ul>
<li>


If <code>OrGoal</code> is executed, 
<code>IloCplex</code>
 will create child nodes. Each of the child nodes will be 
initialized with a copy of the goal stack of the current node. 
Then, for each child node, the specified goal in the <code>OrGoal</code>
 is pushed onto the corresponding goal stack of the child node. 
Finally, the current node is deleted. (See <code>
IloCplex#GoalI::OrGoal</code>
 for a more detailed discussion.)</li><li>


If a cut goal is executed, the constraint will be added to the current node 
relaxation. Constraint goals are provided to represent both 
local and global cuts. Local cut goals are conventionally used 
to express branching.</li><li>


If <code>AndGoal</code>
 is executed, its subgoals are simply pushed onto the stack. (See <code>
IloCplex::GoalI::AndGoal</code>
 for a more detailed discussion.)</li><li>


If <code>
IloCplex::GoalI::FailGoal</code>
 is executed, <code>
IloCplex</code>
 will prune the current node; that is,  
it will discontinue the search at the current node. <code>
IloCplex</code>
 will continue with another node 
if there is one still available in the tree.</li><li>


If <code>
IloCplex::GoalI::SolutionGoal</code>
 is executed, <code>
IloCplex</code>
 will attempt to inject a user-provided solution as a new incumbent. 
Before CPLEX accepts the injected solution, 
it first tests whether the injected solution is feasible with respect to 
the model and goals.</li><li>

When CPLEX executes any other goal, the returned goal is simply pushed 
onto the stack.</li>
</ul><p><code>IloCplex</code>
 continues popping goals from the goal stack until <code>OrGoal</code>
 or <code>FailGoal</code> is executed, 
or until the stack becomes empty; in the case of an empty stack, 
it will continue with a built-in search strategy.</p><p>


The predefined goals <code>OrGoal</code>
 and <code>AndGoal</code>
 allow you to combine goals. <code>AndGoal</code>
 allows you to execute different goals at one node, 
while <code>OrGoal</code>
 allows you to execute different goals on different, newly created nodes. 
A conventional use of these two goals in a return statement of a 
user-written goal looks like this:</p><pre
                class="sample"> 
return AndGoal ( OrGoal (branch1, branch2), this);</pre><p>

This <code>AndGoal</code>
 first pushes <code>this</code>
 (the goal currently being executed) onto the goal stack, 
 and then it pushes the <code>OrGoal</code>. 
Thus the <code>OrGoal</code>
 is on top of the stack and will be executed next. 
When the <code>OrGoal</code> executes, 
it creates two new nodes and copies the remaining goal stack to both of them. 
Thus both new nodes will have <code>this</code>
 goal on top of the goal stack at this point. Then the <code>OrGoal</code>
 proceeds to push <code>branch1</code>
 onto the goal stack of the first child node and <code>branch2</code>
 onto the goal stack of the second goal child node. 
Conventionally, <code>branch1</code> and <code>branch2</code>
 contain cut goals, so by executing <code>branch1</code>
 and <code>branch2</code>
 at the respective child nodes, 
the child nodes will be restricted to represent smaller subproblems 
than their parent. After <code>branch1</code>
 and <code>branch2</code> have been executed, <code>this</code>
 is on top of the node stack of both child nodes; 
that is, both child nodes will continue branching according to the same rule. 
In summary, this example creates the branches <code>branch1</code>
 and <code>branch2</code>
 and continues in both branches to control the same search strategy 
<code>this</code>.</p><p> 
To perform a search using a goal, you need to solve the extracted model 
by calling the method <code>IloCplex::solve(goal)</code>
 with the goal to use as an argument instead of the standard 
<code>IloCplex::solve</code>. The method <code>solve(goal)</code>
 simply pushes the <code>goal</code>
 onto the goal stack of the root node before calling the standard  
<code>solve</code>.</p><p><strong>See Also</strong></p><p><code>IloCplex::Goal</code> and <code>IloCplex::GoalI</code></p></div><div
