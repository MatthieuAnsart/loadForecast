<code>IloStrong</code>, <code>IloCP.strong</code>, <code>CP.Strong</code> in
OPL, C++, Java, and C# respectively) operates over a given set of variables
and is a request for CP Optimizer to strengthen the inference performed
between these variables.</p><p>In CP Optimizer, for reasons of efficiency, not all logical inferences are
performed which logically could be.  For example, given three integer variables
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> and the constraint <em>z = x + y</em>,
then only the <em>bounds</em> of the three variables will be inferred by
CP Optimizer.  For example if the initial bounds of <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and
<em>z</em> are [0..10], [2..7] and [6..9] respectively, then CP Optimizer
can deduce a tighter maximum value of 7 for <em>x</em> since values of 8, 9 or
10 for x would necessarily violate the constraint.  This can be deduced quickly
by examining only at the bounds of the variables.</p><p>Consider now that the domains of <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> can be,
instead of ranges, non-contiguous, for example {0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10},
{2, 4, 6, 7} and {6, 7, 8, 9} respectively.  With these initial domains, it
is impossible to have z = 8 since there is no combination of values for
x and y which can make 8.  So, a logical inference would be to remove 8
from the possible domain of z.  However, since, for efficiency, CP Optimizer
reasons only about ranges on arithmetic constraints, this deduction is
not made.  Normally, the effort spent making such additional deductions on
arithmetic constraints is not paid back by equivalent reductions in the
total search, and so for the most part, fast deductions based on ranges are
globally the best choice.  However, it can be that for some tightly
coupled model structures (by tightly coupled we mean there are relatively
few legal assignments to some subset of the variables and their corresponding
constraints), modeling with constraints which deduce domains reductions
based only on examination of bounds or other simple mechanisms is
inefficient.</p><p>The very strongest domain reductions between variables can be achieved by
using the <em>allowed assignments</em> constraint (specified as
<code>allowedAssignments</code>, <code>IloAllowedAssignments</code>,
<code>IloCP.allowedAssignments</code>, <code>CP.AllowedAssignments</code> in
OPL, C++, Java, and C# respectively).  This constraint takes as input an
array of variables and a <em>tuple set</em>.  The tuple set lists all the
combinations of values that the variables can take.  This constraint
performs perfect (the strongest) domain reductions over the variables
specified and is also a natural way of modeling problems with a naturally
combinatorial structure.  However, where the natural model method uses
other means, such as arithmetic constraints, modeling via the allowed
assignments constraint is somewhat cumbersome.</p><p>The idea then of strong constraints is to allow the user to model the
problem using the constraints which are most natural to them, even if the
default choice of propagation strength is below what the user would prefer
(the strength of allowed-assignments would be preferable). By then using
an additional &quot;strong&quot; constraint on the variables in question, CP Optimizer
is requested to replace the &quot;strong&quot; constraint with an allowed-assignments
constraint which admits the same solutions as the user's constraints, but
provides the maximum strength of inference.  Additionally, if CP Optimizer
can identify that the new allowed-assignments constraint renders some
other constraints in the model entirely redundant (in the sense that all
deductions made are also made by the new allowed-assignments constraint),
then it removes those redundant constraints.</p><p>The allowed-assignments constraints added to the model are generated by
performing a complete search using the whole constraint model, but seeking
only to fix the variables mentioned in the strong constraint during this
search.  Only those partial assignments which did not lead to an inconsistency
(a failure) are added to the allowed-assignments constraint.  This can
actually result in an even stronger model than if the user were to directly
use their own allowed-assignments constraint since in the case of the
strong constraint, the inference of all other constraints in the model is
taken into account.</p><p>For instance reconsidering the example above  
<em>z = x + y</em> where initial domains of <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and 
<em>z</em> are  {0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}, 
{2, 4, 6, 7} and {6, 7, 8, 9}, 
the strong annotation <em>strong(x, y, z)</em> will generate an 
<code>allowedAssignments</code> constraint over 
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> whose tuple set is
</p><pre
                class="sample">
{&lt;0, 6, 6&gt;, 
&lt;0, 7, 7&gt;, 
&lt;3, 4, 7&gt;, 
&lt;3, 6, 9&gt;, 
&lt;5, 2, 7&gt;, 
&lt;5, 4, 9&gt;, 
&lt;7, 2, 9&gt;}
</pre><p>This <code>allowedAssignments</code> constraint replaces the constraint 
<em>z = x + y</em> and the strong annotation. It is important to note 
that for this demonstration we took into account only the constraint 
<em>z = x + y</em>. In general, other constraints on variables 
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>, will lead to a smaller tuple set 
because some of the combinations may not satisfy these other constraints.</p><p>Be aware that the use of strong constraints can be costly for two 
principal reasons :</p><p>1. The allowed-assignments constraints generated, by their very nature of 
performing the maximum amount of inference, are more costly than, for example, 
constraints which only tighten and examine variable bounds. Allowed-assignments 
constraints (and thus strong constraints) on variables with large domains or high 
numbers of variables are likely to be inefficient. </p><p>2. The generation process itself requires some time as a search process is 
carried out during model presolve. The same observations apply as to the first 
point: large domains or numbers of variables in a strong constraint are likely 
to take some time during generation.</p><p>Finally, care should be taken on the number of strong constraints used inside 
a model and to limit their use to the most combinatorial parts. Large numbers of 
allowed-assignments constraints can make the solving process quite inefficient in 
terms of the branching speed of CP Optimizer.</p></div><div
