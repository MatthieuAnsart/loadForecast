 the CP Optimizer engine. This class is the counterpart of the modeling class <code><a
                                href="classes/IloIntervalVar.html">IloIntervalVar</a></code>, 
discussed in the concept <a
                                    href="interval_variables.html">Interval variables in CP Optimizer</a>. 
The member functions of this class give access to the domain 
 of an optimizer engine interval variable. The domain of an interval variable 
 is comprised of the integer range
 domains for start, end, length, and size as well as the Boolean range 
 for the presence. 
Recall the start, end, length and size range are meaningless if the interval is absent.
A solution for an interval is fixed integers for the start, end, length and size if the interval is present; 
see <code><a
                                href="classes/IloCP.html">IloCP</a></code> for more information on how to access these values after 
a successful solve.
</p><p>Member functions give access to 
 the delta domains and events for constraint propagation 
 implementations. These members functions are
 available only during the search process of the optimizer engine.
These domain-deltas are also valid outside of the processing of the interval variable.
</p><p>Figure 1 shows the domain-deltas for the change in the interval integer ranges start, end, length, and size from the last processing of the variable; 
for example the old domain is <em>[oldstart_{min}, oldstart_{max}])</em> and the current domain is <em>[start_{min}, start_{max}]</em> 
which is included in the unchanged range <em>[oldstart_{min}, oldstart_{max}])</em>.</p><p><img

Member functions <code>isOldAbsent()</code> and <code>isOldPresent()</code> access the old value of the presence Boolean. Recall the interval 
integer domain ranges start, end, length, and size are meaningless if the interval is absent. Similarly, the domain-delta for the old interval 
integer ranges start, end, length, and size are meaningless if the interval is old absent; in other words, if the interval was absent the last time it was 
processed by the optimizer engine. Figure 2 shows the domain-delta of a change in the presence of an interval variable. Note that if the presence 
status is set to absent, the domain range of start, end, length and size are no longer displayed.</p><p><img

 The cumul element is zero everywhere (the null function) if the

 sequence variable in the optimizer engine.  The purpose of this class is to sequence a set of intervals,
 instances of <code>IlcIntervalVariable</code>. The modeling counterpart of this class is 
<code><a
                                href="classes/IloIntervalSequenceVar.html">IloIntervalSequenceVar</a></code>, 
discussed in the concept <a
                                href="interval_sequence.html">Interval variable sequencing in CP Optimizer</a>. 
The sequence is a succession of interval variables that is associated with a chronology 
in a scheduling model.</p><ul>
<li> In a solution, an interval can be present or absent. In CP Optimizer, an absent interval does not participate in the 
schedule. Similarly, an interval can be present or absent in the sequence. If absent, the interval does not participate 
in the sequence. Note that being present (absent) for an interval or present (absent) in the sequence may not be identical 
during the propagation of the optimizer.</li><li> In a solution, any interval in the chronological sequence is present, and the chronology begins with the first interval of the sequence 
and traverses the immediate successor (next) intervals until reaching the last interval of the sequence. Conversely, the 
reverse chronology begins with the last interval of the sequence and traverses the immediate predecessor (previous) intervals 
until reaching the first interval of the sequence.</li><li> Before any interval in the sequence, we define a formal sink for the chronological sequence. In the programming interface of the sequence 
variable, this sink is a null handle instance of <code>IlcIntervalVariable</code>. Similarly, after all intervals 
in the sequence there exits 
a formal sink for the  reverse chronological sequence, in the programming interface of the sequence variable; this sink is a 
null handle instance of <code>IlcIntervalVariable</code>.</li>
</ul><p>The full constrained representation of a sequence is a precedence graph whose nodes are the sinks and the intervals valued 
by the presence value. The arcs are directed from a non-absent interval or a sink and point to another non-absent interval 
or a sink. The arcs are valued by the enumeration: possibly/surely/not immediate successor, possibly/surely/not immediate
 predecessor, possibly/surely/not successor and possibly/surely/not predecessor. In other words, the arcs define the sets
 of immediate successors and predecessors or indirect successors and predecessors of an interval. Reducing the domain consists 
in setting an interval present or absent and removing intervals from the different sets of the domain (that is changing the 
valuation of an arc). The main drawbacks of the precedence graph is the quadratic data structure (in terms of the number of 
intervals) for memory usage and the at least linear time maintenance for a change or a decision. Moreover, the 
precedence graph contains more information than needed for chronological heuristics scheduling solution building.</p><p>CP Optimizer supplies a more accurate constrained data structure: the Head-Tail Sequence Graph. The 
constrained domain of the Head-Tail Sequence 
Graph is a restriction of the precedence by a chronologically based partition of the intervals 
of the sequence. Figure 5 shows this restriction with a present interval as a plain circle, and a non-absent interval as a dashed circle.</p><p><img

<li>The head of the sequence is a chronologically ordered set (a subsequence) from the head sink. These intervals are 
&quot;in head&quot; and sequenced. The sink of the head is also in the head and is always present. Upon becoming absent, an interval 
in the head is removed from this subsequence. The first interval in the head is the &quot;earliest in head&quot; interval, and 
the last interval in the head is the &quot;latest in head&quot; interval.</li><li> The tail of the sequence is a reverse chronologically ordered set (a subsequence) from the tail sink. These intervals 
are &quot;in tail&quot; and sequenced. The sink of the tail is also in the tail and is always present. Upon becoming absent, an interval 
in the tail is removed from this subsequence. The first interval in the tail is the &quot;earliest in tail&quot; interval, and the last 
interval in the tail is the &quot;latest in tail&quot; interval.</li><li>The remaining intervals are not sequenced. In order of to have a complete description of the not sequenced 
neighborhood of the head and tail subsequences, these intervals may belong to two unordered subsets. From the head point 
of view, the set of &quot;candidate head&quot; intervals are the intervals that can chronologically extend the head subsequence. 
From the tail point of view, the set of &quot;candidate tail&quot; intervals are the intervals that can extend the tail subsequence.</li>
</ul><p>The sequence is sequenced when any non-absent interval is in the tail or in the head. The sequence is fixed when it is sequenced and 
any interval in the tail or in the head is present in the sequence. Note that if the Head-Tail Graph is not sequenced, there 
is at least one candidate head interval and one candidate tail interval. The sequence solution is given by joining the 
latest interval in the head and latest interval in the tail as immediate neighbors. The solution available from the instance of 
<code><a
                                href="classes/IloCP.html">IloCP</a></code> consists in the first and last intervals and the next and previous interval of a 
present interval.</p><p>The Head-Tail Sequence Graph is linear in memory and changes need O(1) or at most linear
algorithms for propagation and decision making in the context of a chronological a reverse chronological) schedule building.</p><p>An iterator traverses the subsets of the sequence: tail, head, not sequenced, candidate head or candidate tail. As 
shown on Figure 5, the traversal is oriented by the chronology for the head subsequence and by reverse chronology for the 
tail subsequences. Note the iterator is not stable in the case of a change of the Head-Tail Sequence Graph.</p><p>Figure 6 shows the changes that can affect the head subsequence of the Head-Tail graph. Tail subsequence changes are similar.</p><ul>
<li>The first change is the setting of the presence or absence of an interval. Note that, for sake of regularity, you can set 
as present the head or tail sink (no effect) or set as absent the head or tail sink (failure raised by the optimizer engine).</li><li>Building the sequence consists of extending the head with a candidate head interval or extending the tail with a 
candidate tail interval.</li><li> If the head (tail) extension by a candidate head (tail) interval is not allowed, then a remove candidate head (tail) change applies. 
Note that each time the head is extended, the candidate head list of intervals is fully recomputed.</li>

subsequence are the events 
on the Head-Tail Graph. Each of these events corresponds to a domain-delta only available at the processing time of the Head-Tail Graph 
by the optimizer engine. Figure 7 shows the domain-delta for presence change and head extension change.</p><p><img

<li>Presence change: The interval whose presence is fixed is the domain-delta of this event. If the interval becomes absent, 
it is removed from the partition of the sequence after the change has been processed; for example, it remains in the head if it 
was there. This makes it possible to initialize an iterator on a newly absent interval in a propagation algorithm.</li><li>Extension change: the domain-delta is defined from the interval that is the latest in head from the last time the 
head extension was processed: the &quot;earliest newly in head&quot; interval. The head subsequence is partitioned into two 
chronological oriented sets: from the &quot;earliest in head&quot; interval to the &quot;latest in old head&quot;, which is possibly empty, 
and from the &quot;earliest newly in head&quot; interval to the &quot;latest in head&quot; interval is the head-delta, this subsequence being surely 
non-empty. A similar domain-delta is defined on tail extension events.</li>
</ul><p>Notes about decision making:</p><p>Suppose that a chronological schedule is being built. Sequencing an interval sequence variable consists of 
choosing from among the 
candidate head intervals the one that will extend the head subsequence. We suggest that before any extension decision, 
the search traversal fix the presence of all intervals in head. When the sequence is sequenced, it may not be fixed because the 
constraint propagation engine could have placed some not present intervals in the tail. In such a case, the search traversal must 
(chronologically) fix the presence of the intervals in the tail. By chronologically, we means from the &quot;latest in tail&quot; interval 
to the &quot;earliest in tail&quot; interval.</p><p>Sequencing an interval sequence variable is not scheduling the intervals in the sequence, nor is it scheduling the entirety of the interval 
variables in the model. The start and end dates of the intervals must be fixed, and this in a chronological manner. We emphasize you may 
need to interleave sequencing decisions with scheduling and presence setting decisions in a custom search.</p><p>To help you with decisions, CP Optimizer provides an iterator on the in head, in tail, candidate head and candidate tail intervals. 
Furthermore, it defines two choice points for Head-Tail extension: 
<code>IlcGoal IlcIntervalSequenceVar::tryExtendHead(const IlcIntervalVar var) const;</code> and 
<code>IlcGoal IlcIntervalSequenceVar::tryExtendHead(const IlcIntervalVar var) const;</code>.</p><p>Notes about constraint propagation:</p><p>Propagating a constraint on a head-tail interval consists of implementing the filtering algorithm on the events of presence change 
and head-tail extension. The presence change for an interval in head and the head extension filtering algorithm must ensure that 
the constraint conditions hold on the head subsequence. This generally makes it possible to set as absent some intervals in the head. 
A similar filtering 
algorithm exists for the presence in tail change and tail extension.</p><p>The second aspect to consider is the sets of candidate head and tail intervals. An interval must be removed from the set of 
candidate head intervals when it cannot be the immediate successor of an interval between the &quot;latest present in head&quot; interval and 
the &quot;latest in head&quot; interval.</p><p>Lastly, when the sequence variable is sequenced, the head and tail subsequences must be joined. The constraint condition 
must be enforced on the full sequence &quot;earliest in head&quot;-&gt;...-&gt;&quot;latest in head&quot;-&gt;&quot;latest in tail&quot;-&gt;&quot;earliest in tail&quot;.</p><p>To help you with writing the filtering algorithm, CP Optimizer provides access to the immediate neighborhood of an interval 
in head and tail, to the domain-deltas of all events and to two pure sequencing modifiers that constrain the Head-Tail 
Graph: <code>void IlcIntervalSequenceVar::setPrevious(const IlcIntervalVar prev, const IlcIntervalVar next) const</code> and 
<code>IlcIntervalSequenceVar::setBefore(const IlcIntervalVar before, const IlcIntervalVar after) const</code>. </p></div></div></div><div
