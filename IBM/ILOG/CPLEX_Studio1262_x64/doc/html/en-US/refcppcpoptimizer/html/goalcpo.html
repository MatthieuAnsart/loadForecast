  algorithms in CP Optimizer. Both predefined search algorithms and user-defined
  search algorithms can be expressed in CP Optimizer through goals.</p><p>Like other CP Optimizer entities, a goal is implemented by two objects: a
  handle (an instance of the class <code><a
                            href="classes/IlcGoal.html">IlcGoal</a></code>)
  that contains a data member (the handle pointer) that points to an
  implementation object (an instance of the class <code><a
                            href="classes/IlcGoalI.html">IlcGoalI</a></code> allocated on the CP Optimizer heap).</p><p>Among other member functions, the class <code><a
                            href="classes/IlcGoalI.html">IlcGoalI</a></code> has a virtual member function,
  <code>execute</code>, without arguments, which implements the execution of
  the goal. The <code>execute</code> member function must return another goal:
  the <em>subgoal</em> of the goal under execution. If the
  <code>execute</code> member function returns 0 (zero), then no subgoal has
  to be executed. </p><p>A goal can either succeed or fail. A goal fails if a <code>fail</code>
  member function (such as <code><a
                            href="classes/IlcGoalI.html#method_fail">IlcGoalI::fail</a></code>, for
  example) is called during its execution. A goal succeeds if it does not
  fail.</p><p>Goal execution is controlled by the member function <code><a
                        href="classes/IloCP.html#method_next">IloCP::next</a></code> and implemented by a goal stack. The first
  time this member function is called, it pushes all the goals that have been
  added to the invoking optimizer onto the goal stack. Then it pops the top of
  the stack, and if there is a goal there, it executes that goal. When the
  execution of the current goal is complete, its subgoal is executed (if the
  current goal has any subgoals). If there are no remaining subgoals, then the
  next goal on top of the stack is popped. The member function
  <code>next</code> stops when the goal stack is empty.</p><p>See the concept <a
