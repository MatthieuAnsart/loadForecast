  expression.</p><p>Linear expressions consist of terms made up of constants and variables related by 
  arithmetic operations; for example, x + 3y is a linear expression of two terms 
  consisting of two variables. In some expressions, a given variable may appear in more 
  than one term, for example, x + 3y +2x. Concert Technology has more than one way of 
  dealing with linear expressions in this respect, and you control which way Concert 
  Technology treats expressions from your application.</p><p>In one mode, Concert Technology analyzes linear expressions that your application 
  passes it and attempts to reduce them so that a given variable appears in only one term
  in the linear expression. This is the default mode. You set this mode with the member 
  function <code><a
                            href="classes/IloEnv.html#method_setNormalizer">IloEnv::setNormalizer</a>(IloTrue)</code>.</p><p>In the other mode, Concert Technology assumes that no variable appears in more than 
  one term in any of the linear expressions that your application passes to Concert 
  Technology. We call this mode assume normalized linear expressions. You set this mode 
  with the member function <code><a
                            href="classes/IloEnv.html#method_setNormalizer">IloEnv::setNormalizer</a>(IloFalse)</code>.</p><p>In classes such as <code><a
                            href="classes/IloExpr.html">IloExpr</a></code> or 
  <code><a
                            href="classes/IloRange.html">IloRange</a></code>, there are member functions that check the 
  setting of the member function <code><a
                            href="classes/IloEnv.html#method_setNormalizer">IloEnv::setNormalizer</a></code> in the environment and
  behave accordingly. The documentation of those member functions indicates how they behave 
  with respect to normalization.</p><p>When you set <code><a
                            href="classes/IloEnv.html#method_setNormalizer">IloEnv::setNormalizer</a>(IloFalse)</code>, 
  those member functions assume that no variable appears in more than one term in a linear 
  expression. This mode may save time during computation, but it entails the risk that a 
  linear expression may contain one or more variables, each of which appears in one or more 
  terms. Such a case may cause certain assertions in member functions of a class to fail if 
  you do not compile with the flag <code>-DNDEBUG</code>.</p><p>By default, those member functions attempt to reduce expressions. This mode may require 
  more time during preliminary computation, but it avoids of the possibility of a failed 
  assertion in case of duplicates.</p><p>
