<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Briefly describes how to begin working with an OPL model
in the IDE, after the IDE has been installed and launched.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">To work with a model in the IDE, you must first create a project.
The model and  associated data are added to the project.</li>
<li class="li">You create a model with the OPL modeling language in the editing
area of the IDE. You then save the OPL code in a file with the extension <samp class="ph codeph">.mod</samp>.</li>
<li class="li">Usually, you create a data file in the IDE, and save the data
in a file with the extension <samp class="ph codeph">.dat</samp>. You can also have
a simple model with the data inside the model.</li>
<li class="li">Before executing a model, you need to create a run configuration,
and add a model and data file to the run configuration. You then use
the run command on a run configuration. If you want to test a model
with different data files, you need to create a run configuration
for each combination of model + data.</li>
<li class="li">You can also add an optional settings file to a project, or to
a run configuration. If you change the default values of settings,
the new, user-defined, values are stored in the settings file with
the extension <samp class="ph codeph">.ops</samp>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Summary</strong></p>
<p class="p">A project file and a run configuration are mandatory. A model is
contained in a run configuration. It is the run configuration that
is executed. A project can contain several run configurations. Data
files and settings files are optional.</p>
<p class="p">Note that many examples of projects with models and data files
can be found in your installation directory, for example:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph filepath">C:\Program Files\IBM\ILOG\CPLEX_Studio&lt;version&gt;\opl\examples\opl</span></p>
<p class="p">In this document, we will use a distributed example of an OPL project
called 'production'. Here you can see the project structure in the
IDE.</p>
<img class="image" src="../images/ide_project_elements.jpg" alt="Project structure in the IDE of the OPL project named 'production'." /><p class="p">The 'production' project contains two model files and three data
files. These files are used in three different run configurations: <strong class="ph b">Basic
Configuration</strong>, <strong class="ph b">Named data</strong>, and <strong class="ph b">Tuples</strong>. The comment
next to the project name indicates that the problem to be solved uses
Mixed-Integer Linear Programming. The models will call the CPLEX® solving engine.</p>
