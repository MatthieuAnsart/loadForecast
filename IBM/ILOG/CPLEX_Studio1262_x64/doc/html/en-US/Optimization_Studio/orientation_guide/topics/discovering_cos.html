<h1 class="title topictitle1">Discovering CPLEX Optimization
Studio</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Provides an overview of CPLEX® Optimization
Studio, introduces OPL and scripting, and the IDE. Also introduces
the optimization engines CPLEX Optimizer
and CP Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">The main reason for using CPLEX Optimization
Studio is to simplify and speed up the development and deployment
of optimization-based applications. There are two kinds of people
involved in the development of these applications: optimization experts,
who are trained in operations research and know about mathematical
modeling, and software developers, who are responsible for the data
interfaces and the user interfaces that are needed to develop an optimization-based
decision support application.</p>
<p class="p">OPL, the modeling language, allows you to write a mathematical
representation of your problem that is separate from your data.  In
OPL, a project is defined as one or more model files and one or more
data files. Within a project, a run configuration represents a problem
instance with a model and a data file, and you can have multiple run
configurations within an OPL project.</p>
<p class="p">There are two optimization engines. The mathematical programming
optimization engine is called the CPLEX Optimizer
and implements the Simplex method, the Barrier method and Mixed Integer
programming. The constraint programming engine is called CPLEX CP Optimizer. This is another technology
for optimization that is built on artificial intelligence principles.
Constraint programming and mathematical programming are often complementary,
since the strengths of one complement the weaknesses of the other.</p>

OPL language covers the requirements for expressing constraints on
decision variables. However, an optimization application might also
need functionality for manipulating data. This "non-modeling" expressiveness
of OPL is called scripting, and is available as IBM ILOG Script.
It is used to combine OPL models and interact with them. IBM ILOG Script
is an implementation of JavaScript.</p>
