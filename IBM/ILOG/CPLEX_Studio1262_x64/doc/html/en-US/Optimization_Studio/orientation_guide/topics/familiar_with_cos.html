<div class="section" id="familiar_with_cos__ExperimentingWithExamplesInTheIDE"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Experimenting
with OPL models in the IDE</h2><p class="p">To allow you to become more familiar
with OPL models and the IDE, the following tutorials are available.</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../OPL_Studio/usroplide/topics/opl_ide_stats_MP.html#MjEgCFZ3" title="Shows how the IDE displays a dynamically updated progress chart for a mixed integer programming (MIP) example that takes some time to solve.">Understanding solving statistics and progress (MP models)</a></p>
<p class="p">Uses
a model solved by CPLEX Optimizer.
Shows how the IDE displays a dynamically updated progress chart for

<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../OPL_Studio/usroplide/topics/opl_ide_stats_CP.html#lKRJtQZV" title="Shows how the IDE displays a dynamically updated progress chart for a constraint programming example that takes a few seconds to solve.">Understanding solving statistics and progress (CP models)</a></p>
<p class="p">Uses

<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../OPL_Studio/usroplide/topics/opl_ide_extdata.html#GovjXsYo" title="Explains how to connect to data sources from OPL, based on the example of databases, and then provides two practical cases.">Working with external data</a></p>
<p class="p">OPL
allows you to read data from a data source, such as a database or
a spreadsheet. In this case, the data is said to be “external” to
OPL, as opposed to the data in an internal OPL <samp class="ph codeph">.dat</samp> file.
This tutorial uses a model solved by CPLEX Optimizer,
but all the features described work in the same way with a model solved
by CP Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../OPL_Studio/usroplide/topics/opl_ide_script.html#Yoq7DCXd" title="Scripting features are available in the IDE, including script debugging facilities.">Using IBM ILOG Script for OPL</a></p>
<div class="p">Scripting
is used to combine OPL models and interact with them. There are no
separate script files; you write script statements directly in model
files. With scripting, you can:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Add preprocessing instructions to prepare data for a model.</li>
<li class="li">Control the flow while the model is solved.</li>
<li class="li">Set parameters and options.</li>
<li class="li">Add postprocessing instructions to aggregate, transform, and format
data (including results data) for display or for sending to another
application, for example, a spreadsheet.</li>
<li class="li">Solve repeated instances of the same model.</li>
<li class="li">Create solutions where the output of one model instance is used
as the input of a second model instance.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../OPL_Studio/usroplide/topics/opl_ide_relax.html#UwLJkDWH" title="Uses the nurses example to demonstrate how the IDE detects conflicts and searches for relaxations in OPL models that appear infeasible after execution.">Relaxing infeasible models</a></p>
<p class="p">Uses
a MIP example (<samp class="ph codeph">nurses.mod</samp>) to demonstrate how the

<p class="p">When
you execute a run configuration, information about execution time,
memory consumption, and model extraction is collected as part of the
execution. When execution stops, the information appears as a table
in the Profiler output window. This topic explains how the IDE Profiler
table can help you improve your model to make it run faster while
consuming less memory.</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../OPL_Studio/usroplide/topics/opl_ide_solpool.html#wxcltpPw" title="Explains how to access a project solution pool in the IDE and how you can set options and define filters on solution pool generation.">Working with the solution pool</a></p>
<p class="p">OPL
supports the CPLEX solution
pool for mixed integer programming (MIP) models. The solution pool
is a way of generating and keeping more than one solution to a MIP
problem. This allows you to evaluate and explore alternative solutions.
This topic explains how to access a project solution pool in the IDE
and how to set options and define filters on solution pool generation.</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../OPL_Studio/usroplide/topics/opl_ide_perf.html#HAFimJNV" title="Describes how to improve the combination of parameters for the CPLEX part of an OPL model.">Using the performance tuning tool</a></p>
<p class="p">The
performance tuning tool finds the best combination of parameters,
for the CPLEX part of a model,
that can be set in the OPL settings. The tuning can be done for one
or several run configurations so that the search performs best when
your application is deployed. This topic describes how to improve
the combination of parameters for the CPLEX part
of an OPL model.</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../OPL_Studio/usroplide/topics/opl_ide_connect_cplexservers.html#ideconnectiontocplexservers" title="You can connect to CPLEX servers from the IDE in CPLEX Studio.">IDE connection to CPLEX servers</a></p>
<p class="p">You
can connect to CPLEX servers
from the IDE. You can execute one, or several, run configurations
from the same OPL project on a CPLEX server.
You are able to display information about the jobs running on the
servers, and import the result of a successful job from a server.</p>

linear programming (LP) and related problems. Specifically, it solves
linearly or quadratically constrained optimization problems where
the objective to be optimized can be expressed as a linear function
or a convex quadratic function. The variables in the model may be
declared as continuous or further constrained to take only integer
values. This manual describes how to use these component libraries.</p>

of the CP Optimizer functions and classes used in this manual are
documented in the CP Optimizer Reference Manuals. As you study this
manual, you will probably consult the appropriate reference manual
(APIs for C++, Java, and .NET)
from time to time, as it contains precise details on classes and their
members.  CP Optimizer requires a working knowledge of the Microsoft .NET Framework, or
C++, or Java™. However, it does not require you to learn a new language
since it does not impose any syntactic extensions on your programming
language of choice.</p>
