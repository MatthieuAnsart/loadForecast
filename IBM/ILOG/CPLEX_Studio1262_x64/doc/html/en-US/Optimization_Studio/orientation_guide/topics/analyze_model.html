<div class="section" id="analyzingasimpleoplmodel__TheBusinessProblem"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The business problem</h2><p class="p">A
manufacturer has some products he wants to sell, and these products
are manufactured with resources. The products can be made in either
of two ways. They can be made inside the factory, where production
consumes scarce resources and there is a cost per unit to manufacture
the products, or they can be ordered from outside the factory. In
the latter case there is no resource usage but there is a higher cost
per unit to purchase the products. There is a constraint that all
customer demand for the products must be satisfied, and the business
goal is to minimize cost.</p>
<p class="p">The problem is to determine how much
of each product should be produced inside the company and how much
outside, while minimizing the overall production cost, meeting the
demand, and satisfying the resource constraints.</p>

<div class="section" id="analyzingasimpleoplmodel__TheOPLCode"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The OPL code</h2><p class="p">OPL allows
you to write a mathematical representation of your business problem
that is separate from your data. An example of an OPL model, <span class="ph filepath">production.mod</span>,
is shown here. The terms in <strong class="ph b">bold</strong> are OPL keywords.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>{<strong class="ph b">string</strong>} Products = ...;
{<strong class="ph b">string</strong>} Resources = ...;

<strong class="ph b">float</strong> Consumption[Products][Resources] = ...;
<strong class="ph b">float</strong> Capacity[Resources] = ...;

<strong class="ph b">dvar float+</strong> Inside[Products];
<strong class="ph b">dvar float+</strong> Outside[Products];

<strong class="ph b">minimize</strong>
  <strong class="ph b">sum</strong>( p in Products ) 
    ( InsideCost[p] * Inside[p] + OutsideCost[p] * Outside[p] );
   
<strong class="ph b">subject to</strong> {
  <strong class="ph b">forall</strong>( r in Resources )
    ctCapacity: 
      <strong class="ph b">sum</strong>( p in Products ) 
        Consumption[p][r] * Inside[p] &lt;= Capacity[r];

  <strong class="ph b">forall</strong>(p in Products)
    ctDemand:
      Inside[p] + Outside[p] &gt;= Demand[p];
}</code></pre>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The first step in specifying an OPL model is to declare the data,
and in this particular instance the first things you declare are the
index sets, which represent the set of products and the set of resources.<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>{string} Products = ...;
{string} Resources = ...;</code></pre>
<p class="p">These are defined as sets
of strings. That is, the strings are the names of the products and
the resources. On the right-hand side of the equal sign, the  three
dots are the OPL notation to indicate that you read this data from
an external data source, which could be a data file, a spreadsheet,
or a database. You do not have to specify the data within the model;
the data is read in from a data file.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"> Next, you specify the recipe. How many units of each resource
are required for each product?<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>float Consumption[Products][Resources] = ...;</code></pre>
<p class="p">This
is an array, called “Consumption” with two indexes. One index is the
set of products and the other is the set of resources. The notation
“float” indicates a real number. So each entry in this array represents
the amount of resource that is required to produce one unit of each
product.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">There is a capacity available for each resource, or an amount
of each resource available.<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>float Capacity[Resources] = ...;</code></pre>
<p class="p">This
is, again, a real number array, “Capacity”, that is indexed over the
resources.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">A quantity of each product is required. This is an array indexed
by the products, called "Demand," and is also a real number.<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>float Demand[Products] = ...;</code></pre>
</li>
<li class="li">And then there are the costs per unit for production, inside the
factory and outside, of each product.<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>float InsideCost[Products] = ...;
float OutsideCost[Products]  = ...;</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The product in this model could be anything. For example,
it could be jewelry. So we could have a data file that goes with this
particular model when we are producing jewelry that looks like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Products =  { "rings", "earrings" };  //index sets for
Resources = { "gold", "diamonds" };   //products and resources

Consumption = [ [3.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0] ];
Capacity = [ 130, 180 ];
Demand = [ 100, 150 ];
InsideCost = [ 250, 200 ];
OutsideCost  = [ 260, 270 ];</code></pre>
<p class="p">In that case, there are
two products, rings and earrings, and two resources, gold and diamonds.
The recipe calls for three units of gold and one diamond to produce
each ring, or two units of gold and two diamonds for each earring.
For the amount of resources available, there are 130 units of gold
and 180 diamonds. The demand is for 100 rings and 150 pairs of earrings.
The inside cost to produce the rings is $250 and to produce the earrings
it is  $200. The outside cost is $260 for rings and $270 for earrings.</p>
<p class="p">However,
in our distributed example, the products are pasta, and the <span class="ph filepath">production.dat</span> file
looks like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Products =  {"kluski", "capellini", "fettucine"};
Resources = {"flour", "eggs"};

Consumption = [ [0.5, 0.2], [0.4, 0.4], [0.3, 0.6] ];
Capacity = [ 20, 40 ];
Demand = [ 100, 200, 300 ];
InsideCost = [ 0.6, 0.8, 0.3 ];
OutsideCost  = [ 0.8, 0.9, 0.4 ];</code></pre>
<p class="p">In this case there
are three products - kluski, capellini and fettuccine - and there
are two resources, flour and eggs. The consumption here is that producing
a unit of kluski requires half a unit of flour and 0.2 units of eggs,
and so forth for each of the other products. There is a capacity of
20 units of flour and 40 units of eggs. There is a demand of 100,
200, 300 for each of the three products -- kluski, capellini and fettuccine.
And there is an inside and an outside cost to produce each product.</p>
<p class="p">An
important point to note here is that the model is the same for pasta,
for jewelry, or any other product. The model does not depend on the
data.</p>
<p class="p">To return to the model, <span class="ph filepath">production.mod</span>,
we see that two decision variables are specified.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>dvar float+ Inside[Products];
dvar float+ Outside[Products];</code></pre>
<p class="p">The two decision variables
(<samp class="ph codeph">dvar</samp>) are the inside production of each product
and the outside production of each product, and they are specified
as nonnegative real numbers, so we have a simple linear program here.</p>
<p class="p">The
actual specification of the model consists of the objective function
and the constraints. The objective function in our example is to minimize
the total cost of meeting the demand.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>minimize
  sum( p in Products ) 
    ( InsideCost[p] * Inside[p] + OutsideCost[p] * Outside[p] );</code></pre>
<p class="p">This
is the sum over each product in the product set of the inside cost
of producing that product, times the inside production, plus the outside
cost of producing that product, or acquiring that product, times the
outside production.</p>
<p class="p">The objective function is subject to two
constraints.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>subject to {
  forall( r in Resources )
    ctCapacity: 
      sum( p in Products ) 
        Consumption[p][r] * Inside[p] &lt;= Capacity[r];

  forall(p in Products)
    ctDemand:
      Inside[p] + Outside[p] &gt;= Demand[p];</code></pre>
<p class="p">The first
constraint (<samp class="ph codeph">ctCapacity</samp>) is a capacity constraint
on the resources. It says that, for each resource in the set of resources,
the sum over all the products of the consumption of the resource for
that product, times the inside production, has to be less than or
equal to the capacity available for that resource.</p>
<p class="p">The second
constraint (<samp class="ph codeph">ctDemand</samp>) is the demand constraint. It
says that, for each product in the set of products, the inside production
plus the outside production has to be at least as great as the demand.
So, again, this is a simple linear programming problem.</p>
