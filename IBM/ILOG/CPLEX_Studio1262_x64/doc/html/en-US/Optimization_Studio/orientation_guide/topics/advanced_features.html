<div class="section" id="advanced_features__Interfaces"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Interfaces</h2><p class="p">The basic interface
between the model development tools and the optimization engines is
the ILOG Concert Technology,
which is a set of APIs in C++, .NET and Java,
and the OPL programming language is built on top of Concert Technology.
You can also use the optimization engines through their callable libraries,
separately from OPL.</p>

<p class="p"> IBM ILOG OPL
Interfaces enable users to integrate OPL models with IBM ILOG Concert.
They are available in the C++, Java,
and .NET programming languages. This manual provides a tutorial approach
to using these application programming interfaces (APIs), and should
be used in conjunction with the reference manual for the language
you are using.</p>

<p class="p">Offers
explanations of how to use the advanced features of CP Optimizer effectively.
 While the modeling objects provided by IBM ILOG Concert Technology and the
algorithms provided by the CP Optimizer engine will generally be sufficient
to model and solve your problem, in some situations you may need the
full flexibility of writing and maintaining the solution process in
various ways, such as writing custom constraints and custom constructive
search by means of goals. The extensions portion of CP Optimizer is
not available in all APIs.</p>
