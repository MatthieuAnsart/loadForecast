  variables that it involves. CP Optimizer reduces a domain by removing those values that cannot satisfy the constraint 
  and thus cannot participate in a solution.</p><p>Posting a constraint is reversible: the constraint is removed when CP Optimizer backtracks to choice points set before 
  that constraint was posted.</p><p>If constraint propagation causes a domain to be reduced to a single value, then the constrained variable will be 
  bound to that remaining value.</p><p>In addition, when you post a constraint, the constraint is saved so that whenever any of the variables to which it 
  applies is modified, the constraint will be activated, and the modification will be transmitted to the other variables 
  that the constraint involves. This activity is called constraint propagation.</p><p>The algorithm used for constraint propagation in CP Optimizer is straightforward in principle. CP Optimizer maintains a queue of 
  variables, called the constraint propagation queue. When a constrained variable is modified, that variable is put at the 
  end of that queue if it is not already in the queue. As long as there are variables in that queue, the algorithm takes 
  the first variable from the queue. We then say this particular variable is in process.</p><p>When a variable is processed, it is first removed from the propagation queue. Then each constraint posted on that 
  variable is examined. For one such constraint, all the variables on which it is posted are in turn examined: their 
  domains are reduced by removing those values that are inconsistent with it. If a variable is already in process, then 
  this domain reduction will be deferred until it is no longer in process. If some of these variables are modified during 
  this activity, they, too, are put into the queue if they are not yet in the queue. The algorithm continues as long as 
  there is a variable in the queue to process. The algorithm automatically reduces domains as necessary and halts in 
  either of two situations: when all domains contain only values consistent with the constraints, or when a domain becomes 
  empty. For performance considerations, it does not carry out all the reductions theoretically possible.</p><p>This algorithm has several important properties: </p><ul>
<li> This algorithm always halts. </li><li> It lets you use constraints (such as arithmetic constraints, for example) on more than two variables at a time. </li><li> It lets you handle problems dynamically; that is, you can solve problems where new constraints can be added during 
 the search for a solution. </li><li> Regardless of the order in which the constraints are considered, the domains will always be the same at the end of 
 the execution of the propagation. </li>
