A callback is an object 
with a <code>main</code> method implemented by a user.
This user-written <code>main</code> method is called by the
<code>IloCplex</code> algorithm at specific points during 
optimization. 
</p><p>
Callbacks may be called repeatedly at various points during optimization; 
for each place a callback is called, CPLEX provides a separate callback 
class (derived from the class <code>IloCplex::CallbackI</code>). 
Such a callback class provides the specific API as a protected method 
to use for the particular implementation.
</p><p>
There are two varieties of callbacks:
</p><ul>
<li>
Query callbacks enable your application to retrieve information 
about the current solution in an instance of <code>IloCplex</code>. 
The information available depends on the algorithm 
(primal simplex, dual simplex, barrier, mixed integer, or network) 
that you are using. For example, a query callback can return the 
current objective value, the number of simplex iterations that have 
been completed, and other details. Query callbacks can also be called 
from presolve, probing, fractional cuts, and disjunctive cuts.
</li><li>
Control callbacks enable you to direct the search when you are 
solving a MIP in an instance of <code>IloCplex</code>. For example, 
control callbacks enable you to select the next node to process 
or to control the creation of subnodes (among other possibilities).
Control callbacks are an advanced feature of CPLEX, and as such,
they require a greater degree of familiarity with CPLEX algorithms.
</li>
</ul><p>
You do not create instances of the class <code>IloCplex::CallbackI</code>; 
rather, you use one of its child classes to implement your own callback. 
In order to implement your user-written callbacks with an instance of 
<code>IloCplex</code>, you should follow these steps:
</p><ol>
<li>
Determine which kind of callback you want to write, 
and choose the appropriate class for it. The class hierarchy 
in Tree may give you some ideas here.
</li><li>
Derive your own subclass, <code>MyCallbackI</code>, say, 
from the appropriate predefined callback class.
</li><li>
In your subclass of the callback class, use the protected API 
defined in the base class to implement the <code>main</code> 
routine of your user-written callback. (All constructors of 
predefined callback classes are protected; they can be called 
only from user-written derived subclasses.)
</li><li>
In your subclass, implement the method <code>duplicateCallback</code>.
</li><li>
Write a function <code>myCallback</code>, say, 
that creates an instance of your implementation class in the 
Concert Technology environment and returns it as an 
<code>IloCplex::Callback</code> handle.
</li><li>
Create an instance of your callback class and pass it to 
the member function <code>IloCplex::use</code>.
</li>
</ol><p>
There are macros of the form <code>ILOXXXCALLBACKn</code> (for n from 0 to 7)
available to facilitate steps 2 through 5, where <code>XXX</code>
stands for the particular callback under construction and n stands for 
the number of arguments that the function written in step 5 is to receive
in addition to the environment argument.
</p><p>
You can use one instance of a callback with only one instance of 
<code>IloCplex</code>. When you use a callback with a second 
instance of <code>IloCplex</code>, a copy will be automatically 
created using the method <code>duplicateCallback</code>, 
and that copy will be used instead.
</p><p>
Also, an instance of <code>IloCplex</code> takes account of 
only one instance of a particular callback at any given time. 
That is, if you call <code>IloCplex::use</code> more than once 
with the same class of callback, the last call overrides any previous one. 
For example, you can use only one primal simplex callback at a
time, or you can use only one network callback at a time; and so forth.
</p><p>
Existing extractables should never be modified within a callback. 
Temporary extractables, such as arrays, expressions, and range constraints, 
can be created and modified. Temporary extractables are often useful, 
for example, for computing cuts.
</p><p><strong>
Compound Termination Criteria in Callbacks
</strong></p><p>
Here is an example showing you how to terminate optimization
after a given period of time if the solution is good enough.
It uses one of the predefined macros to facilitate writing
a control callback with a timer, a time limit, and a way
to recognize a good enough solution.
</p><pre
                class="sample">
ILOMIPCALLBACK3(MyCallback, IloTimer, myTimer,
                            IloNum, timeLimit,
                            IloNum, acceptableGap) {
  if ( hasIncumbent()  ) {
     IloNum objval = getIncumbentObjValue();
     IloNum bound  = getBestObjValue();
     IloNum gap = fabs(objval - bound) / (1.0 + fabs(bound));
     if ( myTimer.getTime() &gt; timeLimit    &amp;&amp;
                        gap &lt; acceptableGap  ) {
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Good enough solution at = &quot;
             &lt;&lt; myTimer.getTime() &lt;&lt; &quot; sec., gap = &quot;
             &lt;&lt; gap * 100.00 &lt;&lt; &quot;, quitting&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        abort();
     }
  }
