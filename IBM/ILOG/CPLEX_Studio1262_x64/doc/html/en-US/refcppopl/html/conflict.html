Given an infeasible model, the conflict refiner can identify 
conflicting constraints and bounds within the model 
to help you identify the causes of the infeasibility. 
In this context, a conflict is a subset of the constraints 
and bounds of the model which are mutually contradictory. 
The conflict refiner first examines the full infeasible 
model to identify portions of the conflict that it can remove. 
By this process of refinement, the conflict refiner arrives 
at a minimal conflict. A minimal conflict is usually smaller 
than the full infeasible model and thus makes infeasibility 
analysis easier. To invoke the conflict refiner,  call the 
method <code>IloCplex::refineConflict</code>. 
</p><p>
If a model happens to include multiple independent causes of infeasibility, 
then it may be necessary for the user to repair one such cause 
and then repeat the diagnosis with further conflict analysis.
</p><p>
A conflict does not provide information about the magnitude of change 
in data values needed to achieve feasibility. 
The techniques that CPLEX uses to refine a conflict 
include or remove constraints or bounds in trial conflicts; 
the techniques do not vary the data in constraints nor in bounds. 
To gain insight about changes in bounds on variables and constraints, 
consider the FeasOpt feature. 
</p><p>
Also consider FeasOpt for an approach to automatic repair of infeasibility.
</p><p>
Refining a conflict in an infeasible model as defined here 
is similar to finding an irreducibly inconsistent set (IIS), 
an established technique in the published literature, 
long available within CPLEX. Both tools 
(conflict refiner and IIS finder) attempt to identify 
an infeasible subproblem in an infeasible model. 
However, the conflict refiner is more general than the IIS finder. 
The IIS finder is applicable only in continuous (that is, LP) models, 
whereas the conflict refiner can work on any type of problem, 
even mixed integer programs (MIP) and those containing 
quadratic elements (QP or QCP).
</p><p>
Also the conflict refiner differs from the IIS finder in 
that a user may organize constraints into one or more 
groups for a conflict. When a user specifies a group, 
the conflict refiner will make sure that either the group as a whole 
will be present in a conflict (that is, all its members will 
participate in the conflict, and removal of one will result in a 
feasible subproblem) or that the group will not participate 
in the conflict at all. 
</p><p>
See the method 
<code>IloCplex::refineConflictExt</code> 
for more about groups.
</p><p>
A user may also assign a numeric preference to 
constraints or to groups of constraints. In the case of an 
infeasible model having more than one possible conflict, 
preferences guide the conflict refiner toward identifying 
constraints in a conflict as the user prefers. 
</p><p>
In these respects, the conflict refiner represents an 
extension and generalization of the IIS finder.
