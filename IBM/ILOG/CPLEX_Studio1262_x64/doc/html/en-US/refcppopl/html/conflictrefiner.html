Given an infeasible model, the conflict refiner can identify conflicting constraints
and variable domains within the model to help you identify the causes of the
infeasibility. In this context, a conflict is a subset of the constraints and/or
variable domains of the model which are mutually contradictory. The conflict
refiner first examines the full infeasible model to identify portions of the conflict
that it can remove. By this process of refinement, the conflict refiner arrives at
a minimal conflict. A minimal conflict is usually smaller than the full infeasible
model and thus makes infeasibility analysis easier. Since the conflict is minimal,
removal of any one of these constraints will remove that particular cause for
infeasibility. There may be other conflicts in the model; consequently, repair of
a given conflict does not guarantee feasibility of the remaining model. If a model
happens to include multiple independent causes of infeasibility, then it may be
necessary for the user to repair one such cause and then repeat the diagnosis
with further conflict analysis.
</p><p>Consider for instance the following model:</p><pre
                    class="sample">
x, y, z in { 1, 2, 3 }
constraint C1: AllDiff(x,y,z)
constraint C2: z == x + 2y
constraint C3: y &lt; x
constraint C4: z == 2x
</pre><p>
This model is clearly infeasible. Given the domain of variable, subset <code>{C1,C2}</code> is a 
minimal conflict:</p><ul>
<li>it is infeasible because <code>C2</code> implies <code>y=1</code> and <code>x=1</code> 
which violates <code>C1</code></li><li>it is minimal because both subsets <code>{C1}</code> and <code>{C2}</code> are feasible with possible
respective solutions <code>(x=1,y-2,z=3)</code> and <code>(x=1,y=1,z=3)</code>.</li>
</ul><p>Note that in this example, <code>{C1,C2}</code> is not the only minimal conflict. For instance 
<code>{C2,C4}</code> is also a minimal one.</p><p>To invoke the conflict refiner, call one of the <code>IloCP::refineconflict</code> methods. 
For instance:</p><pre
                class="sample">
IloModel model = ...;
IloCP cp(model);
if (cp.refineConflict()) {
  // Model is infeasible
  cp.writeConflict(cp.out());
}
</pre><p>
A user may organize constraints into one or more groups for a conflict. When
a user specifies a group, the conflict refiner will make sure that either the group
as a whole will be present in a conflict (that is, all its members will participate
in the conflict, and removal of one will result in a feasible subproblem) or
that the group will not participate in the conflict at all. See the member function
<code>refineConflict(IloConstraintArray csts)</code>.
</p><p>
A user may also assign a numeric preference to constraints or groups of
constraints. In the case of an infeasible model having more than one possible conflict,
preferences guide the conflict refiner towards identifying constraints in a conflict
as the user prefers. See the member function
<code>refineConflict(IloConstraintArray csts, IloNumArray prefs)</code>.
</p><p>
By default, the conflict refiner works only on the constraints of the model. 
If parameter <code>IloCP::ConflictRefinerOnVariables</code> is set to <code>IloCP::On</code>, the
conflict refiner will consider variable domains as additional (unary) constraints to be 
refined. in this case, it will first identify a minimal conflicting set of
constraints. Then it will refine this conflict further by identifying a minimal subset
of variables whose initial domain is responsible for the infeasibility from amongst 
the decision variables involved in the constraints of the conflict. 
For instance, on the above example for the minimal conflict <code>{C2,C4}</code>,
the conflict refiner would 
additionally identify initial domain of variable <code>z</code> to be sufficient to explain the
infeasibility when used in conjunction with <code>{C2,C4}</code>.
</p><p>some parameters are available to limit the effort of the conflict refiner:</p><ul>
<li><code>IloCP::ConflictRefinerIterationLimit</code>,</li><li><code>IloCP::ConflictRefinerBranchLimit</code>,</li><li><code>IloCP::ConflictRefinerFailLimit,</code> and </li><li><code>IloCP::ConflictRefinerOnVariables</code>.</li>
</ul><p>Once computed, the conflict can be queried with the methods <code>getConflict</code>
and displayed with method <code>writeConflict</code>.</p></div><div
