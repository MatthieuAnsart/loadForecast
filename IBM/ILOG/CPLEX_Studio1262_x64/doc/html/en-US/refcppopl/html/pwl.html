Some problems are most naturally represented by constraints over functions 
that are not purely linear but consist of linear segments. Such functions 
are sometimes known as piecewise linear.

To define a piecewise linear function in CPLEX, 
you need these components:
</p><ul>
<li>
the variable of the piecewise linear function;
</li><li>
the breakpoints of the piecewise linear function;
</li><li>
the slope of each segment 
(that is, the rate of increase or decrease of the function 
between two breakpoints);
</li><li>
the geometric coordinates of at least one point of the function.
</li>
</ul><p>
In other words, for a piecewise linear function of n breakpoints, 
you need to know n+1 slopes. Typically, the breakpoints of a 
piecewise linear function are specified as an array of numeric values. 
The slopes of its segments are indicated as an array of numeric values as well. 
The geometric coordinates of at least one point of the function must also 
be specified. Then in CPLEX, those details are brought together 
by the global function <code>IloPiecewiseLinear</code>.
</p><p>
Another way to specify a piecewise linear function is to give 
the slope of the first segment, two arrays for the coordinates 
of the breakpoints, and the slope of the last segment.  
</p><p>
 For examples of these ways of defining a piecewise linear function, 
see this topic in the <em>CPLEX User's Manual</em>.

Intuitively, in a continuous piecewise linear function, 
the endpoint of one segment has the same coordinates as the 
initial point of the next segment. There are piecewise linear functions, 
however, where two consecutive breakpoints may have the same x coordinate 
but differ in the value of f(x). Such a difference is known as 
a <em>step</em> in the piecewise linear function, 
and such a function is known as <em>discontinuous</em>.
</p><p> 
Syntactically, a step is represented in this way:
</p><ul>
<li>
The value of the first point of a step in the array of slopes 
is the height of the step.
</li><li>
The value of the second point of the step in the array of slopes 
is the slope of the function after the step.
</li>
</ul><p>
By convention, a breakpoint belongs to the segment that starts at 
that breakpoint.
</p><p>
In CPLEX, a discontinuous piecewise linear function is also
represented as an instance of the class created by the global function
<code>IloPiecewiseLinear</code>.
</p><p>
For examples of discontinuous piecewise linear functions, 
see this topic in the <em>CPLEX User's Manual</em>.

Whether it represents a continuous or a discontinuous 
piecewise linear function, an instance of the class created by the global
function <code>IloPiecewiseLinear</code> behaves like a 
floating-point expression. That is, you may use it in a term 
of a linear expression or in a constraint added to a model 
(an instance of <code>IloModel</code>).
