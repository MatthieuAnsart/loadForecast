CPLEX uses 
<em>branch-and-cut search</em> 
when solving mixed integer programming (MIP) models. 
The branch-and-cut procedure manages a search tree 
consisting of <em>nodes</em>. Every node represents 
an LP or QP subproblem to be processed; that is, to be solved, 
to be checked for integrality, and perhaps to be analyzed further. 
Nodes are called <em>active</em> if they have not yet 
been processed. After a node has been processed, it is no longer active. 
Cplex processes active nodes in the tree until 
either no more active nodes are available or some limit has been reached.</p><p>

A <em>branch</em> is the creation of two new nodes from a 
parent node. Typically, a branch occurs when the bounds on a single 
variable are modified, with the new bounds remaining in effect for that 
new node and for any of its descendants. For example, if a branch occurs
on a binary variable, that is, one with a lower bound of 0 (zero) and 
an upper bound of 1 (one), then the result will be two new nodes, 
one node with a modified upper bound of 0 (the downward branch, 
in effect requiring this variable to take only the value 0), 
and the other node with a modified lower bound of 1 (the upward branch, 
placing the variable at 1). The two new nodes will thus have completely 
distinct solution domains.</p><p>

A <em>cut</em> 
is a constraint added to the model. The purpose of adding any cut is to 
limit the size of the solution domain for the continuous LP or QP problems 
represented at the nodes, while not eliminating legal integer solutions. 
The outcome is thus to reduce the number of branches required to 
solve the MIP. </p><p>

As an example of a cut, first consider  
the following constraint involving three binary (0-1) variables:</p><pre
                    class="sample">
20x + 25y + 30z &lt;= 40
</pre><p>

That sample constraint can be strengthened by adding the following 
cut to the model:</p><pre
                class="sample">
1x + 1y + 1z &lt;= 1
</pre><p>
No feasible integer solutions are ruled out by the cut, but some 
fractional solutions, for example (0.0, 0.4, 1.0), can no longer 
be obtained in any LP or QP subproblems at the nodes, possibly 
reducing the amount of searching needed.</p><p>

The branch-and-cut procedure, then, consists of performing branches 
and applying cuts at the nodes of the tree. Here is a more detailed outline 
of the steps involved.</p><p>

First, the branch-and-cut tree is initialized to contain the root node 
as the only active node. The root node of the tree represents the entire 
problem, ignoring all of the explicit integrality requirements. Potential 
cuts are generated for the root node but, in the interest of keeping the 
problem size reasonable, not all such cuts are applied to the model 
immediately. If possible, an incumbent solution (that is, the best known 
solution that satisfies all the integrality requirements) is established 
at this point for later use in the algorithm. 
Such a solution may be established either by CPLEX or by a user who 
specifies a starting solution by means of 
the Callable Library routine <code>CPXcopymipstart</code> or the Concert
Technology method <code>IloCplex::setVectors</code>. 
</p><p> 
If you are solving a sequence of problems by modifying the
problem already in memory and re-solving, then you do not 
need to establish a starting solution explicitly every time,
because for each revised problem, the solution of the previous
problem will be retained as a possible starting solution.
</p><p> 
When processing a node, CPLEX
starts by solving the continuous relaxation of its subproblem. 
that is, the subproblem without integrality constraints. 
If the solution violates any cuts,  CPLEX 
may add some or all of them to the node problem and may resolve it, if
CPLEX has added cuts. 
This procedure is iterated until no more violated cuts are detected 
(or deemed worth adding at this time) by the algorithm. 
If at any point in the addition of cuts the node becomes infeasible, 
the node is pruned (that is, it is removed from the tree).</p><p>

Otherwise, CPLEX 
checks whether the solution of the node-problem satisfies the 
integrality constraints. If so, and if its objective value is better 
than that of the current incumbent, the solution of the node-problem 
is used as the new incumbent. If not, branching will occur, but first 
a heuristic method may be tried at this point to see if a new incumbent 
can be inferred from the LP-QP solution at this node, 
and other methods of analysis may be performed on this node. 
The branch, when it occurs, is performed on a variable where the
value of the present solution violates its integrality requirement. 
This practice results in two new nodes being added to the tree for 
later processing.</p><p>
Each node, after its relaxation is solved, possesses an optimal 
objective function value Z. At any given point in the algorithm, 
there is a node whose Z value is better (less, in the case of a 
minimization problem, or greater for a maximization problem) 
than all the others. This Best Node value can be 
compared to the objective function value of the incumbent solution. 
The resulting MIP Gap, expressed as a percentage of the incumbent solution, 
serves as a measure of progress toward finding and proving optimality. 
When active nodes no longer exist, then these two values will have 
converged toward each other, and the MIP Gap will thus be zero, 
signifying that optimality of the incumbent has been proven.</p><p>

It is possible to tell  CPLEX 
to terminate the branch-and-cut procedure sooner 
than a completed proof of optimality. For example, a user can set
a time limit or a limit on the number of nodes to be processed. 
Indeed, with default settings,  CPLEX 
will terminate the search when the MIP Gap has been brought 
lower than 0.0001 (0.01%), because it is often the case that 
much computation is invested in moving the Best Node value after 
the eventual optimal incumbent has been located. This termination 
criterion for the MIP Gap can be changed by the user, of course.</p></div><div
