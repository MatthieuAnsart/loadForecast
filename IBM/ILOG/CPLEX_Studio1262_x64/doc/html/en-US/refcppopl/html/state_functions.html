                            class="section-body"><p>Some scheduling problems involve reasoning with resources whose state may change over time.
The state of the resource can change because of the scheduled activities or because of exogenous
events, and some activities in the schedule may need a particular condition on the resource
state to be true in order to execute. For instance, the temperature of an oven may change due
to the execution of an activity that sets the oven temperature to a value <em>v</em> and some cooking
activity may require the oven temperature to be maintained at a temperature level <em>v'</em> during
its execution. In some applications, the transition between two states is not instantaneous
and a transition time is needed for the resource to switch from a state <em>v</em> to a state <em>v'</em>.</p><p>CP Optimizer introduces the notion of state function which is a function describing the
evolution of a given feature of the environment. The possible evolution of this feature is
constrained by the interval variables of the problem. The main difference between state functions
and cumul functions (see section Cumul Functions) 
is that interval variables have an incremental effect on cumul
functions (increasing or decreasing the function value) whereas they have an absolute effect
on state functions (requiring the function value to be equal to a particular state or in a set of
possible states).</p><p>Informally speaking, a state function is a set of non-overlapping intervals over which the
function maintains a particular non-negative integer state. In between those intervals, the
state of the function is not defined, typically because of an ongoing transition between two
states (see State Functions and Transition Distance). For instance for an oven with 3 possible temperature levels identified by
indexes 0, 1, and 2 we could have:</p><pre
                            class="sample">[start=0, end=100): state=0,
[start=150, end=250): state=1,
[start=250, end=300): state=1,
[start=320, end=420): state=2,
[start=460, end=560): state=0, ...</pre><p>A set of constraints is available to restrict the evolution of a state function (see Constraints on State Functions).
These constraints make it possible to specify:</p><ul>
<li>that the state of the function must be defined and should remain equal to a given state
        everywhere over a given fixed or variable interval (<em>alwaysEqual</em>),</li><li>that the state of the function must be defined and should remain constant (no matter
        its value) everywhere over a given fixed or variable interval (<em>alwaysConstant</em>),</li><li>that intervals requiring the state of the function to be defined cannot overlap a given
        fixed or variable interval (<em>alwaysNoState</em>), and</li><li>that everywhere over a given fixed or variable interval, the state of the function, if
        defined, must remain within a given range of states [<em>Vmin</em>, <em>Vmax</em>] 
        (<em>alwaysIn</em>).</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, the <em>alwaysEqual</em> and <em>alwaysConstant</em> constraints can be 
complemented to specify that the given fixed
or variable interval should have its start and/or end point synchronized with the start and/or
end point of the interval of the state function that maintains the required state. This is the
notion of start and end alignment which is particularly useful for modelling parallel batches.
For instance in the oven example above, all interval variables that would require an oven
temperature of level 1 and specify a start and end alignment, if executed over the interval
[150, 250) would have to start exactly at 150 and end at 250. This is depicted on figure 6
where <em>a1</em> and <em>a2</em> are two start and end aligned interval variables, <em>a3</em>
is start aligned only and <em>a4</em> is not aligned at all.</p><img

                                alt="image" /><p>The constraints involving interval variables and a state function cannot be used in logical constraints of CP 
Optimizer (see <a
                                href="functions/operator_dif.html">operator!</a>, <a
                    href="functions/operator_or_or.html">operator||</a>). The reason is that any 
logical constraint involving interval variables
must be represented via the presence Boolean value on the interval handled by the <em>presenceOf</em> constraint.
The constraints having this limitation are <em>alwaysIn</em>, <em>alwaysNoState</em>, <em>alwaysConstant</em> and 
<em>alwaysEqual</em>.</p></div></div><div

the minimal distance that must separate two consecutive states in the state function.</p><p>More formally, if <em>M</em>[<em>v, v0</em>] represents a transition distance matrix between state <em>v</em> and state
<em>v'</em>, the transition distance means that:</p><img

</ul><p>In Figure 6, there are two adjacent intervals of state 1: the first one is [150,250) and the second one [250,300}.  There 
are two reasons for that: 250 is end of end-aligned interval <em>a1</em> and also start of start-aligned interval <em>a2</em>.
Therefore due to condition (b) or (c) the interval [150,300) must be split in two (even though the state function does not
change its value).  Note also that thanks to condition (a) the interval <em>a4</em> cannot overlap 250, despite the fact that 
<em>a4</em> is neither start nor end aligned.  To allow <em>a4</em> to overlap 250,  it would be necessary
to use an <em>alwaysIn</em> constraint instead of <em>alwaysEqual</em> -- the difference is that <em>alwaysIn</em> does not
enforce condition (a) even if the allowed state range is singleton (however, <em>alwaysIn</em> also allows the interval to
overlap with state transitions).</p></div></div></div><div
