                            class="section-body"><p>Informally speaking, an interval variable represents an interval of time during which something
happens (a task or an activity is carried out) and whose position in time is an unknown of the
scheduling problem. An interval is characterized by a start value, an end value and a size. An
important additional feature of interval variables is the fact that they can be optional; in other
words, one can decide not to consider them in the solution schedule. This concept is crucial in
applications that present at least some of the following features:</p><ul>
<li>optional activities (operations, tasks) that can be left unperformed (with an impact on
       the cost) : typical examples are externalized, maintenance, or control tasks,</li><li>activities that can execute on a set of alternative resources (machines, manpower) with
       possibly different characteristics (speed, calendar) and compatibility constraints,</li><li>operations that can be processed in different temporal modes (for instance in series or
       in parallel),</li><li>alternative modes for executing a given activity where each mode specifying a particular combination
       of resources,</li><li>alternative processes for executing a given production order where a process being specified
       as a sequence of operations requiring resources,</li><li>hierarchical description of a project as a work-breakdown structure with tasks decomposed
       into sub-tasks, part of the project being optional (with an impact on the cost if
       unperformed), etc.</li>
</ul><p>More formally, an <strong>interval variable </strong><em>a</em> is a variable whose domain <em>dom(a)</em> is a subset of</p><img
                            src="images/int_var1.png"
                                alt="image" /><p>An interval variable is said to be fixed if its domain is reduced to a singleton, i.e., if <img
                                src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                    alt="image" /> 
denotes a fixed interval variable:</p><ul>
<li>interval is <strong>absent</strong>: <img
                                    src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                    alt="image" /> =  <img
                                    src="images/perp.png"
                                    alt="image" /> ; or</li><li>interval is <strong>present</strong>: <img

                                alt="image" /> = [<em>s</em>,<em>e</em>)</li>
</ul><p>Absent interval variables have special meaning. Informally speaking, an absent interval
variable is not considered by any constraint or expression on interval variables that it is involved in.
For example, if an absent interval variable is used in a <code>noOverlap</code> constraint, the constraint
will behave as if the interval was never specified to the constraint. If an absent interval variable
<em>a</em> is used in a precedence constraint between interval variables <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> this 
constraint does not impact interval variable <em>b</em>. Each constraint specifies how it handles absent interval 
variables.</p><p>In this document, the semantics of constraints defined over interval variables is described
by the properties that fixed intervals must have in order the constraint to be true. If a fixed
interval <img
                                src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                alt="image" /> is present and such that 
<img
                                src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                alt="image" /> = [<em>s</em>, <em>e</em>), we will 
denote <em>s</em>(<img
                                src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                alt="image" />) its integer start value 
<em>s</em>, <em>e</em>(<img
                                src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                alt="image" />)
its integer end value <em>e</em> and <em>l</em>(<img
                                src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                alt="image" />) 
its positive integer length defined as
<em>e</em>(<img
                                src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                alt="image" />)-<em>s</em>(<img
                                src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                alt="image" />). 
The presence status <em>x</em>(<img
                                src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                alt="image" />) will be equal to 1. 
For a fixed interval that is absent, 
<em>x</em>(<img
                                src="images/a_underscore.png"
                                alt="image" />) = 0 and the start, end, and length are undefined.</p><p>Until a solution is found it may not be known whether an interval will be present or not.
In this case we say that the interval is optional. To be precise, an interval is said to be absent
when <em>dom</em>(<em>a</em>) = {<img
                                src="images/perp.png"
                                alt="image" />}, present when <img
                                src="images/perp.png" alt="image" /><img
                                src="images/notin.png"
                                    alt="image" /><em>dom</em>(<em>a</em>) and optional in all other cases.</p><p>The start and end of an interval variable must be in <code>[<a
                                    href="macros/IloIntervalMin.html">IloIntervalMin</a>..<a
                                href="macros/IloIntervalMax.html">IloIntervalMax</a>]</code>.</p><p>All constraints involving interval variables cannot be used in logical constraints of CP 
Optimizer (see <a
                                href="functions/operator_dif.html">operator!</a>, <a
                    href="functions/operator_or_or.html">operator||</a>) except for the presence constraint. 
The reason is that any logical constraint involving interval variables
must be captured by the presence Boolean value on the interval handled by the <em>presenceOf</em> constraint.
The constraints having this limitation are precedence constraints, constraints <em>forbidStart</em>, <em>forbidEnd</em>, 
<em>forbidExtent</em> and constraints on groups of interval variables such as <em>span</em>, <em>synchronize</em> 
and <em>alternative</em>.</p></div></div><div

consider a worker who does not work during weekends (his work intensity during weekends is
0%) and on Friday he works only for half a day (his intensity during Friday is 50%). For this
worker, 7 man-days work will span for longer than just 7 days. In this example 7 man-days
represent what we call the size of the interval: that is, the length of the interval would be if
the intensity function was always at 100%.</p><p>To model such situations, you can specify a range for the size of an interval variable and an
integer <strong>stepwise intensity function</strong>&nbsp; whose step bounds are integer <em>F</em> 
(see <a
                                href="pwl_and_sw_functions.html">Piecewise linear and stepwise functions in CP Optimizer</a>).

relation will be enforced at any solution between the start, end, size <em>sz</em> of the interval and the
integer granularity <em>G</em> (by default, the intensity function is expressed as a percentage so the
granularity <em>G</em> is 100):</p><img

                                alt="image" /><p>The length of the interval will be at least long enough to cover the work requirements
given by the interval size, taking into account the intensity function. However, any
over-estimation is always strictly less than one work unit.</p><p>If no intensity is specified, it is assumed to be the constant full intensity function

Note that the size is not defined for absent intervals.</p><p><strong>Important: The intensity step function F is a stepwise function with integer values
and is not allowed to exceed the granularity (100 by default).</strong></p><p>Figure 2 depicts an interval variable of size 14 and an associated intensity function. A
valid solution is represented where the interval starts at 10 and ends at 27. In this case,</p><img

After the name of the interval variable (here <code>A1</code>), the first range (here 0..1) represents

The remaining fields describe the position of the interval variable, it is omitted if the interval 
variable is absent as this information is not relevant in this case. Thus, an absent interval variable is displayed as:
