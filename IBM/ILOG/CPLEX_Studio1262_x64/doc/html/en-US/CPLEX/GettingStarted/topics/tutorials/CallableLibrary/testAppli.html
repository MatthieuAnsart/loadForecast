<p class="p">After an application works correctly, it still may have errors
or features that inhibit execution speed. To get the most out of your
application, be sure to test its performance as well as its correctness.
Again, the Interactive Optimizer can help. Since the Interactive Optimizer
uses the same routines as the Callable Library, it should take the
same amount of time to solve a problem as a Callable Library application. </p>
<p class="p">Use the <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/writeprob.html" title="The routine CPXXwriteprob/CPXwriteprob writes a CPLEX problem object to a file in one of the formats in the table.">CPXwriteprob</a></samp> routine
with the SAV format to create a binary representation of the problem
object, then read it in and solve it with the Interactive Optimizer.
If the application sets optimization parameters, use the same settings
with the Interactive Optimizer. If your application takes significantly
longer than the Interactive Optimizer, performance within your application
can probably be improved. In such a case, possible performance inhibitors
include fragmentation of memory, unnecessary compiler and linker options,
and coding approaches that slow the program without causing it to
give incorrect results.</p>
