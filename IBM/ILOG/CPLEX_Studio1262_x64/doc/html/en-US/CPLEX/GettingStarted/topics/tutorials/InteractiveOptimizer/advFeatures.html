<body role="main" id="descriptiveTopic1218464213811">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">Advanced features of the Interactive Optimizer</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Further reading about advanced features of the
Interactive Optimizer is available in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX User's
Manual</em>.</p>
<p class="p">This introduction to the Interactive Optimizer presents
most of the commands and their options. There are also other, more
advanced features of the Interactive Optimizer, documented in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX User's Manual</em>. Here short descriptions of those
advanced features and links to further information about them.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">tuning tool</strong> can help you discern nondefault
parameter settings that lead to faster solving time.  <a class="xref" href="../../../../UsrMan/topics/progr_consid/tuning/09_eg_time_limits.html" title="Shows the effect of both deterministic and nondeterministic time limits on the tuning tool in the Interactive Optimizer.">Examples: time limits on tuning in the Interactive Optimizer</a> shows how to use
the tuning tool in the Interactive Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">solution pool</strong> stores multiple solutions
to a mixed integer programming (MIP) model. With this feature, you
can direct the optimizer to generate multiple solutions in addition
to the optimal solution. CPLEX offers facilities to manage the solution
pool and to access members of the solution pool. <a class="xref" href="../../../../UsrMan/topics/discr_optim/soln_pool/01_soln_pool_title_synopsis.html" title="Introduces the solution pool for storing multiple solutions to a mixed integer programming problem (MIP) and explains techniques for generating and managing those solutions.">Solution pool: generating and keeping multiple solutions</a> describes those facilities
and documents the corresponding commands of the Interactive Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">conflict refiner</strong> diagnoses the cause
of infeasibility in a model or MIP start, whether continuous or discrete,
whether linear or quadratic. <a class="xref" href="../../../../UsrMan/topics/infeas_unbd/conflict_refiner/01_ref_confl_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes the conflict refiner, a feature for diagnosing the cause of infeasibility in a model, whether continuous or discrete, whether linear or quadratic.">Diagnosing infeasibility by refining conflicts</a> documents the conflict
refiner generally, and <a class="xref" href="../../../../UsrMan/topics/infeas_unbd/conflict_refiner/06_Interactive_title_synopsis.html" title="Introduces the conflict refiner in the Interactive Optimizer.">Meet the conflict refiner in the Interactive Optimizer</a> introduces the conflict
refiner as a feature of the Interactive Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">FeasOpt</strong> attempts to repair an infeasibility
by modifying the model according to preferences set by the user. FeasOpt
accepts an infeasible model and selectively relaxes the bounds and
constraints in a way that minimizes a weighted penalty function that
you define. <a class="xref" href="../../../../UsrMan/topics/infeas_unbd/feasopt/01_feasopt_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents FeasOpt, a feature for repairing infeasibility in a model.">Repairing infeasibilities with FeasOpt</a> documents this feature
and refers throughout to commands available in the Interactive Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">The user may supply a <strong class="ph b">MIP start</strong>, also
known as an <strong class="ph b">advanced start</strong> or a <strong class="ph b">warm start</strong>,
to serve as the first integer solution when CPLEX solves a MIP. Such
a solution might come from a MIP problem solved previously or from
the user's knowledge of the problem, for example. <a class="xref" href="../../../../UsrMan/topics/discr_optim/mip/para/49_mipStarts.html#User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__section1218614208185">MIP starts and the Interactive Optimizer</a> introduces commands of the Interactive Optimizer
to manage MIP starts.</p>
