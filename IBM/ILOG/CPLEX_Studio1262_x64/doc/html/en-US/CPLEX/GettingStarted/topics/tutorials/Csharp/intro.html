<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX in the .NET framework supports creating a model,
populating it with data, solving the problem, and displaying results
of the solution.</p>
<p class="p">This tutorial introduces CPLEX through Concert Technology
in the .NET framework. It gives you an overview of a typical application
and highlights procedures for:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Creating a model</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Populating the model with data, either
by rows, by columns, or by nonzeros</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Solving that model</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Displaying results after solving</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">This chapter concentrates on an example using C#.NET.
There are also examples of VB.NET (Visual Basic in the .NET framework)
delivered with CPLEX in <em class="ph i">yourCPLEXhome</em><samp class="ph codeph">\examples\src\vb</samp> . Because of their .NET
framework, those VB.NET examples differ from the traditional Visual
Basic examples that may already be familiar to some CPLEX users. </p>
<p class="p">In the standard distribution of the product, the file <samp class="ph codeph">dotnet.html</samp> offers useful details about installing
the product as well as compiling and executing examples.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">This tutorial is based on a procedure-based learning
strategy. The tutorial is built around a sample problem, available
in a file that can be opened in an integrated development environment,
such as Microsoft Visual Studio. As you follow the steps in the tutorial,
you can examine the code and apply concepts explained in the tutorial.
Then you compile and execute the code to analyze the results. Ideally,
as you work through the tutorial, you are sitting in front of your
computer with CPLEX and Concert Technology for .NET users already
installed and available in Microsoft Visual Studio. </p>
