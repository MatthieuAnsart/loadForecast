<h1 class="title topictitle1">Opening the CPLEX environment</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Your Callable Library application initializes the CPLEX
environment.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX requires a number of internal data structures in order to
execute properly. These data structures must be initialized before
any call to the CPLEX Callable Library. The first call to the CPLEX
Callable Library is always to the routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/openCPLEX.html" title="The routine CPXXopenCPLEX/CPXopenCPLEX initializes a CPLEX environment.">CPXopenCPLEX</a></samp>.
 This routine returns a pointer to the CPLEX environment. This pointer
is then passed to every CPLEX Callable Library routine, except those,
such as <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/msg.html" title="The routine CPXXmsg/CPXmsg writes a message to a specified channel.">CPXmsg</a></samp>,
 which do not require an environment.</p>
<p class="p">The application developer must make an independent decision as
to whether the variable containing the environment pointer is a global
or local variable. Multiple environments are allowed, but extensive
opening and closing of environments may create significant overhead
and degrade performance; typical applications make use of only one
environment for the entire execution, since a single environment may
hold as many problem objects as the user wants. After all calls to
the Callable Library are complete, the environment is released by
the routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/closeCPLEX.html" title="This routine frees all of the data structures associated with CPLEX.">CPXcloseCPLEX</a></samp>.
 This routine specifies to CPLEX that all calls to the Callable Library
are complete, any memory allocated by CPLEX is returned to the operating
system, and the use of CPLEX is ended for this run.</p>
