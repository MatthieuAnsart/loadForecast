<h1 class="title topictitle1">Changing the problem object</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">If your Callable Library application modifies the problem
object, consider these issues.</p>
<p class="p">A major consideration in the design of CPLEX is the need to re-optimize
modified linear programs efficiently. In order to accomplish that,
CPLEX must be aware of changes that have been made to a linear program
since it was last optimized. Problem modification routines are available
in the Callable Library.</p>
<p class="p">Do not change the problem by changing the original problem data
arrays and then making a call to <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/copylp.html" title="The routine CPXXcopylp/CPXcopylp copies data that define an LP problem to a CPLEX problem object.">CPXcopylp</a></samp>.
Instead, change the problem using the problem modification routines,
allowing CPLEX to make use of as much solution information as possible
from the solution of the problem before the modifications took place. </p>
<p class="p">For example, suppose that a problem has been solved, and that the
user has changed the upper bound on a variable through an appropriate
call to the CPLEX Callable Library. A re-optimization would then begin
from the previous optimal basis, and if that old basis were still
optimal, then that information would be returned without even the
need to refactor the old basis.</p>
