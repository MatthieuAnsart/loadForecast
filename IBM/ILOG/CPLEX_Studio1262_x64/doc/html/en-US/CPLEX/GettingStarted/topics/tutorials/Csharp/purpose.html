<h1 class="title topictitle1">What you will be doing</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">This tutorial walks you through building and solving
a small linear programming model in C#.NET..</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX can work together with Concert Technology for .NET
users, a .NET library that allows you to model optimization problems
independently of the algorithms used to solve the problem. It provides
an extensible modeling layer adapted to a variety of algorithms ready
to use off the shelf. This modeling layer enables you to change your
model, without completely rewriting your application.</p>
<p class="p">To find a solution to a problem by means of CPLEX with
Concert Technology for .NET users, you use a three-stage method: describe,
model, and solve.</p>
<p class="p">The first stage is to describe the problem in natural
language. </p>
<p class="p">The second stage is to use the classes and interfaces
of Concert Technology for .NET users to model the problem. The model
is composed of data, decision variables, and constraints. Decision
variables are the unknown information in a problem. Each decision
variable has a domain of possible values. The constraints are limits
or restrictions on combinations of values for these decision variables.
The model may also contain an objective, an expression that can be
maximized or minimized.</p>
<p class="p">The third stage is to use the classes of Concert Technology
for .NET users to solve the problem. Solving the problem consists
of finding a value for each decision variable while simultaneously
satisfying the constraints and maximizing or minimizing an objective,
if one is included in the model. </p>
<p class="p">In these tutorials, you will describe, model, and solve
a simple problem that also appears elsewhere in C, C++, and Java chapters
of this manual:</p>

<div class="section" id="Getting_started.uss_csharpStart.1017243__Getting_started.uss_csharpStart.1017371"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Describe</h2><p class="p">The first step is for you to describe the problem in
natural language and answer basic questions about the problem.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">What is the known information in this
problem? That is, what data is available?</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">What is the unknown information in this
problem? That is, what are the decision variables? </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">What are the limitations in the problem?
That is, what are the constraints on the decision variables?</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">What is the purpose of solving this
problem? That is, what is the objective function?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">Though the <strong class="ph b">Describe</strong> step of the process may seem trivial in a simple problem like this
one, you will find that taking the time to fully describe a more complex
problem is vital for creating a successful application. You will be
able to code your application more quickly and effectively if you
take the time to describe the model, isolating the decision variables,
constraints, and objective. </p>
