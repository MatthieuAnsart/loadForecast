<h1 class="title topictitle1">Modeling by columns</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Java methods support modeling by columns in this example
of a Java application of CPLEX.</p>
<p class="p">While for many examples population by rows may seem most
straightforward and natural, there are some models where population
by columns is a more natural or more efficient approach to implement.
For example, problems with network structure typically lend themselves
well to modeling by column. Readers familiar with matrix algebra may
view the method <samp class="ph codeph">populateByColumn</samp> as producing
the transpose of what is produced by the method <samp class="ph codeph">populateByRow</samp> .
In contrast to modeling by rows, modeling by columns means that the
coefficients of the constraint matrix are given in a column-wise way.
As each column represents the constraint coefficients for a given
variable in the linear program, this modeling approach is most natural
where it is easy to access the matrix coefficients by iterating through
all the variables, such as in network flow problems.</p>
<p class="p">Range objects are created for modeling by column with
only their lower and upper bound. No expressions are given; building
them at this point would be impossible since the variables have not
been created yet. Similarly, the objective function is created only
with its intended optimization sense, and without any expression. </p>
<p class="p">Next the variables are created and installed in the existing
ranges and objective. These newly created variables are introduced
into the ranges and the objective by means of column objects, which
are implemented in the class  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloColumn</a>. Objects of
this class are created with the methods IloCplex. <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/cplex/IloCplex.html#column(ilog.concert.IloLPMatrix%20lp)" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">column</a>, and can be linked together with the method IloColumn. <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html#and(ilog.concert.IloColumn%20column)" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">and</a> to form aggregate  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloColumn</a> objects.</p>
<p class="p">An instance of   <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloColumn</a> created with
the method IloCplex. <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/cplex/IloCplex.html#column(ilog.concert.IloLPMatrix%20lp)" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">column</a> contains information about how to use this column
to introduce a new variable into an existing modeling object. For
example, if <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> is an instance of a class
that implements the interface  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloObjective.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloObjective</a>, then <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.column(obj,
2.0)</samp> creates an instance of  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloColumn</a> containing the
information to install a new variable in the expression of the  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloObjective.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloObjective</a> object <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> with
a linear coefficient of <samp class="ph codeph">2.0</samp>. Similarly,
for <samp class="ph codeph">rng</samp>, a constraint that is an instance
of a class that implements the interface  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloRange.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloRange</a>, the invocation of the method <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.column(rng, -1.0)</samp> creates
an  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloColumn</a> object containing
the information to install a new variable into the expression of <samp class="ph codeph">rng</samp> ,
as a linear term with coefficient <samp class="ph codeph">-1.0</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">When you use the approach of modeling by column, new
columns are created and installed as variables in all existing modeling
objects where they are needed. To do this with Concert Technology,
you create an  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloColumn</a> object for every
modeling object in which you want to install a new variable, and link
them together with the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloColumn</samp>. <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html#and(ilog.concert.IloColumn%20column)" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">and</a> . For example, the first variable in <samp class="ph codeph">populateByColumn</samp> is
created like this:</p>
<p class="p">The three methods <samp class="ph codeph">model.column</samp> create  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refjavacplex/html/ilog/concert/IloColumn.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloColumn</a> objects for
installing a new variable in the objective <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> and
in the constraints <samp class="ph codeph">r0</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">r1</samp>,
with linear coefficients <samp class="ph codeph">1.0</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">-1.0</samp>,
and <samp class="ph codeph">1.0</samp>, respectively. They are all linked
to an aggregate column object by the method <samp class="ph codeph">and</samp>.
This aggregate column object is passed as the first argument to the
method <samp class="ph codeph">numVar</samp>, along with the bounds <samp class="ph codeph">0.0</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">40.0</samp> as
the other two arguments. The method <samp class="ph codeph">numVar</samp> now
creates a new variable and immediately installs it in the modeling
objects <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">r0</samp>,
and <samp class="ph codeph">r1</samp> as defined by the aggregate column
object. After it has been installed, the new variable is returned
and stored in <samp class="ph codeph">var[0][0]</samp>.</p>
