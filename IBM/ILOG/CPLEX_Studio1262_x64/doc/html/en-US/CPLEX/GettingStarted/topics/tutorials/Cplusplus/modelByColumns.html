<title>Modeling by columns</title>

<h1 class="title topictitle1">Modeling by columns</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX also supports the approach of modeling by columns
in the sample.</p>
<p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">populatebycolumn</samp> can
be viewed as the transpose of <samp class="ph codeph">populatebyrow</samp>.
While, for simple examples like this one, population by rows may seem
the most straightforward and natural approach, there are some models
where modeling by column is a more natural or more efficient approach.</p>
<p class="p">When an application creates a model by columns, range
objects are created with their lower and upper bound only. No expression
is given since the variables are not yet created. Similarly, the objective
function is created with only its intended optimization sense, and
without any expression. Next the variables are created and installed
in the already existing ranges and objective.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Column expressions</em> provide
the description of how the newly created variables are to be installed
in the ranges and objective. These column expressions are represented
by the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumColumn</samp>. Column expressions
consist of objects of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloAddNumVar</samp> linked
together with the operator <samp class="ph codeph">+</samp>. These <samp class="ph codeph">IloAddNumVar</samp> objects
are created using the operator<samp class="ph codeph">()</samp> of the
classes <samp class="ph codeph">IloObjective</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp>.
These overloaded operators define how to install a new variable to
the invoking objective or range objects. For example, <samp class="ph codeph">obj(1.0)</samp> creates
an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloAddNumVar</samp> capable of
adding a new modeling variable with a linear coefficient of 1.0 to
the expression in <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp>. Column expressions
can be built in loops by means of the operator <samp class="ph codeph">+=</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">Column expressions (objects of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumColumn</samp>)
are handle objects, like most other Concert Technology objects. The
method <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> must therefore be called to
delete the associated implementation object when it is no longer needed.
However, for implicit column expressions, where no <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumColumn</samp> object
is explicitly created, such as the ones used in this example, the
method <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> should not be called.</p>
<p class="p">The column expression is passed as an argument to the
constructor of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar</samp>. For
example the constructor <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar(obj(1.0) + c[0](-1.0)
+ c[1]( 1.0), 0.0, 40.0)</samp> creates a new modeling variable
with lower bound 0.0, upper bound 40.0 and, by default, type <samp class="ph codeph">ILOFLOAT</samp>,
and adds it to the objective <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> with a
linear coefficient of 1.0, to the range <samp class="ph codeph">c[0]</samp> with
a linear coefficient of -1.0 and to <samp class="ph codeph">c[1]</samp> with
a linear coefficient of 1.0. Column expressions can be used directly
to construct numeric variables with default bounds <samp class="ph codeph">[0,
IloInfinity]</samp> and type <samp class="ph codeph">ILOFLOAT</samp>,
as in the following statement:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>x.add(obj(2.0) + c[0]( 1.0) + c[1](-3.0));</code></pre>
<p class="p">where <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar</samp> does not need
to be explicitly written. Here, the C++ compiler recognizes that an <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar</samp> object
needs to be passed to the <samp class="ph codeph">add</samp> method and
therefore automatically calls the constructor <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar(IloNumColumn)</samp> in
order to create the variable from the column expression.</p>
