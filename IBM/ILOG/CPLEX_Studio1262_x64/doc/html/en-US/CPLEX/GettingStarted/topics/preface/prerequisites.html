<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Prerequisites for effective use of CPLEX include
familiarity with your operating system, knowledge of file management,
and facility in a programming language.</p>
<p class="p">In order to use CPLEX effectively, you need to be familiar
with your operating system.</p>
<p class="p">This manual assumes you already know how to create and
manage files. In addition, if you are building an application that
uses the Component Libraries, this manual assumes that you know how
to compile, link, and execute programs written in a high-level language.
The Callable Library is written in the C programming language, while
Concert Technology is available for users of C++, Java, and the .NET
framework. This manual also assumes that you already know how to program
in the appropriate language and that you will consult a programming
guide when you have questions in that area.</p>
