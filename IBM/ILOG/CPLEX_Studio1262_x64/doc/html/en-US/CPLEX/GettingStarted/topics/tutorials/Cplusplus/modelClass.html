<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX C++ offers modeling objects for an application.</p>
<p class="p">After creating the environment, a Concert application
is ready to create one or more optimization models. Doing so consists
of creating a set of modeling objects to define each optimization
model.</p>
<p class="p">Modeling objects, like  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloEnv.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloEnv</a>  objects, are handles to implementation objects.
Though you will be dealing only with the handle objects, it is the
implementation objects that contain the data that specifies the optimization
model. If you need to remove an implementation object from memory,
you need to call the <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> method for one
of its handle objects.</p>
<p class="p">Modeling objects are also known as <em class="ph i">extractables</em> because it is the individual
modeling objects that are extracted one by one when you extract an
optimization model to  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloCplex</a> . So, extractables are characterized by the possibility
of being extracted to algorithms such as <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> .
In fact, they all are inherited from the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloExtractable</samp> .
In other words, <samp class="ph codeph">IloExtractable</samp> is the base
class of all classes of extractables or modeling objects.</p>
<p class="p">The most fundamental extractable class is <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel</samp> .
Objects of this class are used to define a complete optimization model
that can later be extracted to an 
<a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloCplex</a>  object. 
You create a model by constructing an object of type 
<a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloModel.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloModel</a>. 
For example, to construct a modeling object named <samp class="ph codeph">model</samp>,
within an existing environment named <samp class="ph codeph">env</samp>,
you write the following line:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloModel model(env);</code></pre>
<p class="p">At this point, it is important to note that the environment
is passed as an argument to the constructor. There is also a constructor
that does not use the environment argument, but this constructor creates
an empty handle, the handle corresponding to a <samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> pointer.
Empty handles cannot be used for anything but for assigning other
handles to them. Unfortunately, it is a common mistake to try to use
empty handles for other things.</p>
<p class="p">After an <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloModel.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloModel</a>  
object has been constructed, it is populated with
the extractables that define the optimization model. The most important
classes here are: </p>

<td class="entry" valign="top"> representing an objective function. </td>
</tr>

</table>
</div>
<p class="p">You create objects of these classes for each variable,
constraint, and objective function of your optimization problem. Then
you add the objects to the model by calling</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>model.add(object);</code></pre>
<p class="p">for each extractable <samp class="ph codeph">object</samp> .
There is no need to explicitly add the variable objects to a model,
as they are implicitly added when they are used in the range constraints
(instances of <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> ) or the objective.
At most one objective can be used in a model with  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IloCplex</a> .</p>
<p class="p">Modeling variables are constructed as objects of class <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar</samp> ,
by defining variables of type <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar</samp> .
Concert Technology provides several constructors for doing this; the
most flexible form is:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloNumVar x1(env, 0.0, 40.0, ILOFLOAT);</code></pre>
<p class="p">This definition creates the modeling variable <samp class="ph codeph">x1</samp> with
lower bound 0.0, upper bound 40.0 and type <samp class="ph codeph">ILOFLOAT</samp> ,
which indicates the variable is continuous. Other possible variable
types include <samp class="ph codeph">ILOINT</samp> for integer variables
and <samp class="ph codeph">ILOBOOL</samp> for Boolean variables.</p>
<p class="p">For each variable in the optimization model a corresponding
object of class <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar</samp> must be created.
Concert Technology provides a wealth of ways to help you construct
all the <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar</samp> objects.</p>
<p class="p">After all the modeling variables have been constructed,
they can be used to build expressions, which in turn are used to define
objects of class <samp class="ph codeph">IloObjective</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> .
 For example,</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloObjective obj = IloMinimize(env, x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3);</code></pre>
<p class="p">This creates the extractable <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> of
type <samp class="ph codeph">IloObjective</samp> which represents the
objective function of the example presented in <a class="xref" href="../../preface/preface_synopsis.html" title="This preface introduces CPLEX.">Introducing CPLEX</a>.</p>
<p class="p">Consider in more detail what this line does. The function <samp class="ph codeph">IloMinimize</samp> takes
the environment and an expression as arguments, and constructs a new <samp class="ph codeph">IloObjective</samp> object
from it that defines the objective function to minimize the expression.
This new object is returned and assigned to the new handle <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> .</p>
<p class="p">After an objective extractable is created, it must be
added to the model. As noted above this is done with the <samp class="ph codeph">add</samp> method
of <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel</samp> . If this is all that the variable <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> is
needed for, it can be written more compactly, like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>model.add(IloMinimize(env, x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3));</code></pre>
<p class="p">This way there is no need for the program variable <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> and
the program is shorter. If in contrast, the objective function is
needed later, for example, to change it and re-optimize the model
when doing scenario analysis, the variable <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> must
be created in order to refer to the objective function. (From the
standpoint of algorithmic efficiency, the two approaches are comparable.)</p>
<p class="p">Creating constraints and adding them to the model can
be done just as easily with the following statement:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>model.add(-x1 + x2 + x3 &lt;= 20);</code></pre>
<p class="p">The part <samp class="ph codeph">-x1 + x2 + x3 &lt;= 20</samp> creates
an object of class <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> that is immediately
added to the model by passing it to the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel::add</samp> .
Again, if a reference to the <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> object
is needed later, an <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> handle object
must be stored for it. Concert Technology provides flexible array
classes for storing data, such as these <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> objects.
As with variables, Concert Technology provides a variety of constructors
that help create range constraints.</p>
<p class="p">While those examples use expressions with modeling variables
directly for modeling, it should be pointed out that such expressions
are themselves represented by yet another Concert Technology class, <samp class="ph codeph">IloExpr</samp> .
Like most Concert Technology objects, <samp class="ph codeph">IloExpr</samp> objects
are handles. Consequently, the method <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> must
be called when the object is no longer needed. The only exceptions
are implicit expressions, where the user does not create an <samp class="ph codeph">IloExpr</samp> object,
such as when writing (for example) <samp class="ph codeph">x1 + 2*x2</samp> .
For such implicit expressions, the method <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> should
not be called. The importance of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloExpr</samp> becomes
clear when expressions can no longer be fully spelled out in the source
code but need instead to be built up in a loop. Operators like <samp class="ph codeph">+=</samp> provide
an efficient way to do this.</p>
