<title>Deleting entire constraints or variables</title>

<body role="main" id="Getting_started.uss_interactiveOptimizerStart.151277">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">Deleting entire constraints or variables</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The Interactive Optimizer supports these options of the delete command.</p>
<p class="p">Another option to the <samp class="ph codeph">change</samp> command
is <samp class="ph codeph">delete</samp>. This option is used to remove
an entire constraint or a variable from a problem. Return the problem
to its original form by removing the constraint you added earlier.
Type:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>change delete </code></pre>
<p class="p"> CPLEX displays a list of delete options. </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Delete options:

constraints      delete range of constraints
qconstraints     delete range of quadratic constraints
indconstraints   delete range of indicator constraints
soss             delete range of special ordered sets
variables        delete range of variables
filters          delete range of filters
solutions        delete range of solutions from the pool
equality         delete range of equality constraints
greater-than     delete range of greater-than constraints
less-than        delete range of less-than constraints
mipstarts        delete range of mipstarts

Deletion to make:
</code></pre>
<p class="p">At the first prompt, specify that you want to delete
a constraint.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> Deletion to make: constraints </code></pre>
<p class="p">At the next prompt, enter a constraint name or number,
or a range as you did when you used the <samp class="ph codeph">display</samp> command.
Since the constraint to be deleted is named <samp class="ph codeph">new3</samp>,
enter that name:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Delete which constraint(s): new3 
Constraint 3 deleted.</code></pre>
<p class="p">Check to be sure that the correct range or number is
specified when you perform this operation, since constraints are permanently
removed from the problem. Indices of any constraints that appeared
after a deleted constraint will be decremented to reflect the removal
of that constraint.</p>
<p class="p">The last message indicates that the operation is complete.
The problem can now be checked to see if it has been changed back
to its original form. </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>display problem all 

Maximize
 obj:  x1 + 2 x2 + 3 x3
Subject To
 c1: - x1 +   x2 +   x3 &lt;= 20
 c2:   x1 - 3 x2 +   x3 &lt;= 30
Bounds
 0 &lt;= x1 &lt;= 40
All other variables are &gt;= 0.</code></pre>
<p class="p">When you remove a constraint with the <samp class="ph codeph">delete</samp> option,
that constraint no longer exists in memory; however, variables that
appear in the deleted constraint are not removed from memory. If a
variable from the deleted constraint appears in the objective function,
it may still influence the solution process. If that is not what you
want, these variables can be explicitly removed using the <samp class="ph codeph">delete</samp> option. </p>
