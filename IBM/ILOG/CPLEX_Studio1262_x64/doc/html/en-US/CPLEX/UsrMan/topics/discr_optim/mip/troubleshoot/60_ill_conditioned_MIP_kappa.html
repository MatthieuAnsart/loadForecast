<h1 class="title topictitle1">MIP kappa: detecting and coping with ill-conditioned MIP models</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Recommends techniques to detect ill conditioning in your MIP model.</p>
<p class="p"> To help you evaluate ill-conditioning and numerical difficulties
in your model, CPLEX offers an optional report of the condition number, that is, MIP kappa statistics
based on the simplex solutions of node relaxations during MIP optimization. To generate such
a report, set the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/MIPKappaStats.html#languageRefTopic1266237349678" title="Sets the strategy for computing statistics about MIP kappa">MIP kappa computation</a><samp class="ph codeph">(CPX_PARAM_MIPKAPPASTATS,
MIPKappaStats)</samp> documented in the <em class="ph i">Parameter Reference Manual</em>. </p>
<p class="p"> When you set that parameter to report kappa statistics
about your model, CPLEX tells you whether it encountered suspicious,
unstable, or ill-posed bases while solving your model. For a definition
of the range of condition numbers for suspicious, unstable, and ill-posed
bases, see the documentation of these symbols in the reference manuals
of the APIs: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">CPX_KAPPA_SUSPICIOUS</samp> or  <samp class="ph codeph">KappaSuspicious</samp> 
reports the percentage of numerically suspicious simplex bases  (condition
number kappa between 1e+7 and 1e+10)  among simplex bases encountered
during a MIP solve.</li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">CPX_KAPPA_UNSTABLE</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">KappaUnstable</samp> 
reports the percentage of numerically unstable simplex bases  (condition
number kappa between 1e+10 and 1e+14)  among simplex bases encountered
during a MIP solve.</li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">CPX_KAPPA_ILLPOSED</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">KappaIllposed</samp> 
reports the percentage of numerically ill-posed simplex bases  (condition
number greater than 1e+14)  among simplex bases encountered during
a MIP solve.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Here is a sample from a log file showing results when the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_MIPKAPPASTATS=2</samp> tells
CPLEX to compute MIP kappa for all LP subproblems:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>MILP objective                                -2.1989035553e+06
MILP solution norm |x| (Total, Max)            1.95445e+10  1.68134e+08
MILP solution error (Ax=b) (Total, Max)        3.90105e+05  8.14760e+03
MILP x bound error (Total, Max)                0.00000e+00  0.00000e+00
MILP x integrality error (Total, Max)          1.96296e-06  9.81482e-07
MILP slack bound error (Total, Max)            8.27493e-08  2.95847e-09

Branch-and-cut subproblem optimization:
Max condition number:                    1.9347e+12
Percentage (number) of stable bases:      0.00%   (0)
Percentage (number) of suspicious bases: 99.97%   (16518157)
Percentage (number) of unstable bases:    0.03%   (5044)
Percentage (number) of ill-posed bases:   0.00%   (0)
Attention level:                         0.010089</code></pre>
<p class="p"> In such a report, the <strong class="ph b">attention level</strong> estimates the probability
of numerical difficulties for the given sample of condition numbers.
When the attention level is 0 (zero), CPLEX encountered only stable
bases while solving the model.  When the attention level is strictly
greater than 0 (zero), CPLEX encountered at least one basis that is
not stable. The maximum value of attention level is 1 (one), reporting
that all the bases are ill-posed. </p>
<p class="p"> You should reconsider your model if CPLEX reports any ill-posed
bases or more than 5% unstable bases. </p>
<p class="p"> In a report like that sample, consider the solution norm values.
If the report shows large solution norm values, check the lower order
decimal places for round off error. If the round off error exceeds
the tolerances set for this optimization, you can encounter inconsistent
results and other numerical difficulties. </p>
<p class="p"> For example, that sample report of solution quality shows that
the maximum individual x value is on the order of 1e+8. Conventional
machine precision is 1e-16; that is, there are 16 digits of accuracy;
that is, values beyond the eighth decimal place are likely to arise
from round-off error. CPLEX uses default tolerances for feasibility
and optimality of 1e-6 implying that the solution in the sample report
is sound. However, for the particular model in that sample report,
it would not be a good idea to reduce the CPLEX feasibility and optimality
tolerances to 1e-8 or less. </p>
<p class="p"> Also consider the solution error in the report. The solution error
is a vector of residuals on the constraints; that is: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>b - Ax</code></pre>
<p class="p"> The <strong class="ph b">Max solution error</strong> is the maximum individual absolute
residual element in that vector. The <strong class="ph b">Total solution error</strong> is
the sum of the absolute values of all elements in that vector. 
In that sample report, both the maximum and total solution error are quite significant.</p>
<p class="p"> 
Acceptable <strong class="ph b">residual levels</strong> depend on the magnitude of the numerical values in the problem.
In other words, whether residuals are too great or not depends on your model and data. 
For most models, one would expect residuals no larger than the feasibility tolerance used to solve the model. 
In this case (as reported in that sample), the residuals are much larger. In fact, the
residuals are so much larger that they warrant investigation. </p>
<p class="p">To detect the source of the large residuals and to assess their 
importance, start by looking for constraints with large right hand side values 
where a modest relative violation in the constraint results in a large absolute violation.  
Then, examine the nonzero matrix and associated variable values for such constraints.  
This procedure suggests the cause of the large residuals.  Possible remedies include 
rescaling constraints with extremely large coefficients or 
reformulating parts of the model to reduce large solution values.</p>
<p class="p"> Even a small percentage of ill-posed bases in the MIP kappa statistics
is cause for concern about the model.  Likewise, a significant percentage
of unstable bases raises concern about the model. For practical suggestions
about how to address such concerns, see the popular CPLEX Tech Note <em class="ph i">Diagnosing
ill conditioning</em> at your IBM Support Portal: http://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399993 </p>
