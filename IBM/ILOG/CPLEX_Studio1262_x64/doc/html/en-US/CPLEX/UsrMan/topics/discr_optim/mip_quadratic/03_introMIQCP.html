<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Distinguishes types of mixed integer 
quadratically constrained programs according to 
quadratic terms in the constraints of the model.</p>
<p class="p">As introduced in the topic 
<a class="xref" href="../mip/02_prob_statement.html" title="Defines the kind of problems that the mixed integer optimizer solves.">Stating a MIP problem</a>,
a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem can contain
both integer and continuous variables. If the problem contains an
objective function with no quadratic term, (a <em class="ph i">linear objective)</em>, then the problem
is termed a <em class="ph i">Mixed Integer Linear Program</em> (MILP). </p>
<p class="p">If there is a quadratic term in the objective function, 
the problem is termed a <em class="ph i">Mixed Integer Quadratic Program</em> (MIQP). 
(For more information about solving a MIQP, see the topic 
<a class="xref" href="02_introMIQP.html" title="Distinguishes types of mixed integer programs according to quadratic terms in the objective function or constraints of the model.">MIQP: mixed integer programs with quadratic terms in the objective function</a>.)
If the model has any <strong class="ph b">constraints</strong> 
containing a quadratic term, regardless of the objective function,
the problem is termed a <em class="ph i">Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Program</em> 
(MIQCP).</p>
<p class="p">This topic explores MIQCP further and specifies the features of 
MIQCP problems that CPLEX solves.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX can solve a mixed integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP) 
satisfying these conditions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">when the objective function is linear</li>
<li class="li">when the objective function contains quadratic terms and is convex</li>
<li class="li">when the constraints that contain a quadratic term are second order 
cone programs (SOCP)</li>
<li class="li">when the quadratic term in a constraint involves only multiplication of binary variables</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The topics  
<a class="xref" href="../../cont_optim/qcp/03_QCP_defn.html" title="Describes the characteristics of a quadratically constrained program.">Characteristics of a quadratically constrained program</a> and 
<a class="xref" href="../../cont_optim/qcp/04_convexity.html" title="Defines convexity in the context of a quadratically constrained program.">Convexity</a>
clarify the difference between convex and nonconvex quadratically 
constrained programs (QCP). 
That same distinction is relevant to MIQCP problems as well. By default, 
CPLEX can solve MIQCPs where the restriction of the problem to its continuous 
and general integer variables is a <strong class="ph b">convex</strong> 
quadratically constrained program (QCP). 
If this assumption is not satisfied, CPLEX will return the error
