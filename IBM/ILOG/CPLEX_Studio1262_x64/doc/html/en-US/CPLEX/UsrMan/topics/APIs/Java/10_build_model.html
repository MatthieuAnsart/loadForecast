<h1 class="title topictitle1">Building the model</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Uses the diet example to demonstrate building a model
for CPLEX in Java.</p>
<p class="p">All the building blocks are now in place to implement
a method that creates a model. The diet problem consists of finding
the least expensive diet using a set of foods such that all nutritional
requirements are satisfied. The example in this chapter builds the
specific diet model, chooses an optimizing algorithm, and shows how
to access more detailed information about the solution.</p>
<p class="p">The example includes a set of foods, where food <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp> has
a unit cost of <samp class="ph codeph">foodCost[j].</samp> The minimum
and maximum amount of food <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp> which can
be used in the diet is designated <samp class="ph codeph">foodMin[j]</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">foodMax[j]</samp>,
respectively. Each food <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp> also has a nutritional
value <samp class="ph codeph">nutrPerFood[i][j]</samp> for all possible
nutrients <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>. The nutritional requirement
states that in the diet the amount of every nutrient <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> consumed
must be within the bounds <samp class="ph codeph">nutrMin[i]</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">nutrMax[i]</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">Mathematically, this problem can be modeled using a variable <samp class="ph codeph">Buy[j]</samp> for
each food <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp> indicating the amount of food <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp> to
buy for the diet. Then the objective is: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>minimize ∑j (Buy[j] * foodCost[j])</code></pre>
<p class="p">The nutritional requirements mean that the following
conditions must be observed; that is, for all <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> : </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>nutriMin[i] ≤ ∑i nutrPerFood[i][j] * Buy[j] ≤ nutriMax[i]</code></pre>
<p class="p">Finally, every food must be within its bounds; that is,
for all <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp> : </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>foodMin[j] ≤ Buy[j] ≤ foodMax[j]
</code></pre>
<p class="p">With what you have learned so far, you can implement
a method that creates such a model. </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> static void buildModelByRow(IloModeler     model,
                              Data          data,
                              IloNumVar[]   Buy,
                              IloNumVarType type) 
    throws IloException {
    int nFoods = data.nFoods;
    int nNutrs = data.nNutrs;

    for (int j = 0; j &lt; nFoods; j++) {
      Buy[j] = model.numVar(data.foodMin[j], data.foodMax[j], type);
    }
    model.addMinimize(model.scalProd(data.foodCost, Buy));

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; nNutrs; i++) {
      model.addRange(data.nutrMin[i],
                     model.scalProd(data.nutrPerFood[i], Buy),
                     data.nutrMax[i]);
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The function accepts several arguments. The argument <samp class="ph codeph">model</samp> is
used for two purposes: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">creating other modeling objects, and</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">representing the model being created. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The argument <samp class="ph codeph">data</samp> contains
the data for the model to be built. The argument <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp> is
an array, initialized to length <samp class="ph codeph">data.nFoods</samp>,
containing the model's variables. Finally, the argument <samp class="ph codeph">type</samp> is
used to specify the type of the variables being created.</p>
<p class="p"> The function starts by creating the modeling variables,
one by one, and storing them in the array <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp>.
Each variable <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp> is initialized to have
bounds <samp class="ph codeph">data.foodMin[j]</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">data.foodMax[j]</samp> and
to be of type <samp class="ph codeph">type</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">The variables are first used to construct the objective
function expression with the method <samp class="ph codeph">model.scalProd(foodCost,
Buy)</samp>. This expression is immediately used to create
the minimization objective which is directly added to the active model
by <samp class="ph codeph">addMinimize</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">In the loop that follows, the nutritional constraints
are added. For each nutrient <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> the expression
representing the amount of nutrient in a diet with food levels <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp> is
computed using <samp class="ph codeph">model.scalProd(nutrPerFood[i], Buy)</samp>.
This amount of nutrient must be within the ranged constraint bounds <samp class="ph codeph">nutrMin[i]</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">nutrMax[i]</samp>.
This constraint is created and added to the active model with <samp class="ph codeph">addRange</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">Note that function <samp class="ph codeph">buildModelByRow</samp> uses
the interface <samp class="ph codeph">IloModeler</samp> rather than <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp>.
This convention allows the function to be called without change in
another implementation of <samp class="ph codeph">IloModeler</samp>, such
as <samp class="ph codeph">IloCP</samp>.</p>
