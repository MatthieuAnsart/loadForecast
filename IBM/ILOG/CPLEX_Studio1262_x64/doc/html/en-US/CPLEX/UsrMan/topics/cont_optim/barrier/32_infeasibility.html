<h1 class="title topictitle1">Diagnosing infeasibility reported by barrier optimizer</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains information about an infeasible solution from
the barrier optimizer and its implications in diagnosing sources of
infeasibility.</p>
<p class="p">When the CPLEX barrier optimizer terminates and reports
an infeasible solution, all the usual solution information is available.
However, the solution values, reduced costs, and dual variables reported
then do not correspond to a basis; hence, that information does not
have the same meaning as the corresponding output from the CPLEX simplex
optimizers.</p>
<p class="p">Actually, since the CPLEX barrier optimizer works in
a single phase, all reduced costs and dual variables are calculated
in terms of the original objective function.</p>
<p class="p">If the CPLEX barrier optimizer reports to you that a
problem is infeasible, one approach to overcoming the infeasibility
is to invoke FeasOpt or the conflict refiner. See <a class="xref" href="../../infeas_unbd/feasopt/01_feasopt_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents FeasOpt, a feature for repairing infeasibility in a model.">Repairing infeasibilities with FeasOpt</a> and <a class="xref" href="../../infeas_unbd/conflict_refiner/01_ref_confl_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes the conflict refiner, a feature for diagnosing the cause of infeasibility in a model, whether continuous or discrete, whether linear or quadratic.">Diagnosing infeasibility by refining conflicts</a> for an explanation of these tools.</p>
<p class="p">If the CPLEX barrier optimizer reports to you that a
problem is infeasible, but you still need a basic solution for the
problem, use the primal simplex optimizer. CPLEX will then use the solution
provided by the barrier optimizer to find a starting basis for the
primal simplex optimizer. When the primal simplex optimizer finishes
its work, you will have an infeasible basic solution for further infeasibility
analysis.</p>
<p class="p">If the default algorithm in the CPLEX barrier optimizer
discovers that your problem is primal infeasible or dual infeasible,
then try the alternate algorithms in the barrier optimizer. These
algorithms, though slower than the default, are better at detecting
primal and dual infeasibility. </p>
<p class="p">To select one of the barrier infeasibility algorithms,
set the <samp class="ph codeph">BarAlg</samp> parameter to either <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">2</samp>.</p>
