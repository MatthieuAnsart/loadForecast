<h1 class="title topictitle1">Before you begin</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Consider these general observations before you attempt the 
following instructions.</p>
<p class="p">The following topics document several ways of using distributed parallel 
optimization, that is, the distributed parallel mixed integer programming (MIP) 
algorithm implemented in CPLEX. For simplicity and consistency, these topics 
assume that the user has a Linux operating system and works in a bash shell. 
However, these instructions apply to other operating systems in analogous ways.</p>
<div class="p">If you are not using Linux, you may need to adapt the following points in the 
instructional topics:
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong>: The distributed parallel MIP algorithm implemented in CPLEX uses
    dynamically loadable libraries. You have to prepare the runtime linker so that it
    can find those libraries when CPLEX requests them. On Linux this is done by pointing
    the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to the directory that contains the CPLEX
    dynamically loadable libraries. On other operating systems this variable may have
    different names. For example, on MacOS it is called DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, on AIX it is
    called LIBPATH and on Windows it is PATH.
    </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Shared libraries</strong>: On Linux, the names of shared libraries files 
conventionally have the suffix <samp class="ph codeph">.so</samp>.
    On other operating systems, the suffix is different. For example, on MacOS, the 
    suffix is <samp class="ph codeph">.dyld</samp>. On AIX, the suffix is <samp class="ph codeph">.a</samp>.
    On Windows, the suffix is <samp class="ph codeph">.dll</samp>.</li>
<li class="li">Not all transports (process, MPI, TCP/IP) are available on all platforms. 
Consequently, certain features documented in the following topics 
 may be unavailable on your platform. In particular, there
    are several platforms on which the MPI transport is not available.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">For simplicity, the instructions in the following topics assume that you have deployed
CPLEX in a directory that is shared over the network by all the machines involved in 
your distributed application. This practice (an installation directory shared across a 
network) is the conceptually simplest way to deploy CPLEX for distributed parallel MIP.
However, by no means is a "network share" a requirement to run the CPLEX
distributed MIP algorithm. Indeed, it is perfectly fine to deploy CPLEX to a local directory
on each machine involved.</p>
