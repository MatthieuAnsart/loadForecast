<h1 class="title topictitle1">Starting from a solution: MIP starts</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Documents advanced starts; also known as warm
starts or MIP starts.</p>
<p class="p">When you are solving a mixed integer programming problem
(MIP), you can supply hints to help CPLEX find an initial solution.
These hints consist of pairs of variables and values, known as a <strong class="ph b">MIP start</strong>, an <strong class="ph b">advanced start</strong>, or a <strong class="ph b">warm start</strong>. A MIP start might come from a different problem
you have previously solved or from your knowledge of the problem,
for example. You can also provide CPLEX with one or more MIP starts,
that is, multiple MIP starts.</p>
<p class="p">A MIP start may be a feasible solution of the model, but
it need not be; it may even be infeasible or incomplete. If you are
interested in debugging an infeasible MIP start, that is, if you want
to discover why CPLEX regards the model inferred from the pairs of
variables and values in a MIP start as infeasible, consider using
the conflict refiner on that model inferred from that MIP start, as
explained in <a class="xref" href="../../../infeas_unbd/conflict_refiner/22_MIPstart.html" title="Describes how a MIP start may be used with the conflict refiner.">Refining a conflict in a MIP start</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__B6g2YxGP"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What are the characteristics
of a MIP start?</h2><p class="p">A MIP start may include continuous variables and discrete
variables of various types, such as integer variables, binary variables,
semi-continuous variables, semi-integer variables, or variables appearing
in special ordered sets. For more information about each of those
types, see these topics in this manual:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../semi_cont_var/01_SemiCont_title_synopsis.html" title="Demonstrates semi-continuous variables in Concert Technology in an example of managing production in a power plant.">Using semi-continuous variables: a rates example</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">You may specify values for any combination of discrete
and continuous variables. CPLEX decides how to construct a starting
point from these variable-value pairs depending on the specified values
and on the specified effort level. For more detail about effort level,
see <a class="xref" href="49_mipStarts.html#User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__section1218612714531">MIP starts and effort level</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__section1219740389375"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Managing
a MIP start with the advanced start switch</h2><p class="p">After
a MIP start has been established for your model, you control its use
by the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/AdvInd.html" title="If set to 1 or 2, this parameter specifies that CPLEX should use advanced starting information when it initiates optimization.">advanced start switch</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">AdvInd</samp> in
Concert Technology; <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_ADVIND</samp> in
the Callable Library). At the default setting of 1 (one) , the MIP
start values that you specify are used. If you set <samp class="ph codeph">AdvInd</samp> to
the value 0 (zero), then the MIP start will not be used. If you set
this parameter to 2, CPLEX retains the current incumbent (if there
is one), re-applies presolve, and starts a new search from a new root.
Setting 2 can be particularly useful for solving fixed MIP models,
where a start vector but no corresponding basis is available. For
more about a fixed MIP, see <a class="xref" href="51_soln.html#User_manual.uss_solveMIP.683642__paragroup1219739495795">Working with the fixed MIP problem</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__CFsLmpbc"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using a MIP start</h2><p class="p">When you provide a MIP start as data, CPLEX processes it
before starting branch and cut during an optimization. If one or more
of the MIP starts define a solution, CPLEX installs the best of these
solutions as the <strong class="ph b">incumbent</strong> solution. Having an incumbent
from the very beginning of branch and cut allows CPLEX to eliminate
portions of the search space and thus may result in smaller branch-and-cut
trees. Having an incumbent also allows CPLEX to use heuristics which
require an incumbent, such as relaxation induced neighborhood search
(RINS heuristic) or solution polishing.</p>
<p class="p">You
may invoke relaxation induced neighborhood search on a starting solution.
See <a class="xref" href="../heuristics/45_rins.html" title="Describes RINS as a heuristic of the MIP optimizer.">Relaxation induced neighborhood search (RINS) heuristic</a> in this manual for more about that
topic. </p>
<p class="p">Alternatively, you may invoke solution polishing
to improve a solution known to CPLEX. See <a class="xref" href="../heuristics/46_soln_polish.html" title="Describes solution polishing as a heuristic of the MIP optimizer.">Solution polishing</a>, also in this manual, for more
about that way of proceeding.</p>

<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__section1220902034761"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Establishing
starting values in a MIP start</h2><p class="p">You can establish
MIP starting values by using the method <samp class="ph codeph">addMIPStart</samp> in
a <strong class="ph b">Concert Technology</strong> application, or by using <samp class="ph codeph">CPXaddmipstarts</samp> in a <strong class="ph b">Callable Library</strong> application.</p>
<p class="p">For use in the <strong class="ph b">Interactive Optimizer</strong>, or
as an alternative approach in a Concert Technology or Callable Library
application, you can establish MIP starting values in a formatted
file and then read the file.</p>
<p class="p">To read a MIP start from a formatted file, use one of these:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">the method <samp class="ph codeph">readMIPStart</samp> in <strong class="ph b">Concert Technology</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> the routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXreadcopymipstarts</samp> in

 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the command <samp class="ph codeph">read</samp> in
the <strong class="ph b">Interactive Optimizer</strong></p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">You can establish MIP starting values from a file
in either MST or SOL format. MST and SOL share the same underlying
XML format. MST format is documented in <a class="xref" href="../../../../../FileFormats/topics/MST.html" title="The MST file format supports MIP starts.">MST file format: MIP starts</a> in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX

</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__SisG4XLS"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Creating a file for
a MIP start</h2><p class="p">At the end of a MIP optimization, when a feasible (not necessarily
optimal) solution is still in memory, you can create an MST file for

</ul>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span>  <p class="p">Make sure that the name
of each variable is consistent between the original model and your
target model when you use this approach.</p>
 </div>
<p class="p">When
you tell CPLEX to write a MIP start to a formatted file, you can also
specify a degree of detail to record there, such as only values of
discrete variables, values of all variables, and so forth. The <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/WriteLevel.html" title="Sets a level of detail for CPLEX to write a file in MST or SOL format.">write level for MST, SOL files</a> is a parameter (<samp class="ph codeph">WriteLevel</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_WRITELEVEL</samp>),
documented in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX Parameter Reference Manual</em>,
to manage the level of detail.</p>
<p class="p">When CPLEX reads from
such a file, it processes <strong class="ph b">all</strong> the MIP starts. They
will be processed at the next MIP optimization. Immediately after
an optimization, the first MIP start is the MIP start corresponding
to the incumbent solution, so if you write a file with multiple MIP
starts, the <strong class="ph b">first</strong> MIP start will be that corresponding
to the <strong class="ph b">incumbent</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">Because processing
a large number of MIP starts may be costly, CPLEX allows you to associate
an individual <strong class="ph b">effort level</strong> with each MIP start. The
effort level tells CPLEX how to expend its effort in processing that
MIP start. For more detail about effort level, see <a class="xref" href="49_mipStarts.html#User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__section1218612714531">MIP starts and effort level</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__section1218612714531"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MIP starts
and effort level</h2><p class="p">You may want CPLEX to process multiple MIP starts differently,
expending more effort on some than on others. Moreover, you may want
to limit the effort CPLEX applies to MIP starts when it transforms
each MIP start into a feasible solution, especially if there are many
of them. In that context, you can specify a level of effort that CPLEX
should expend for each MIP start to transform it into a feasible solution. </p>
<p class="p">You specify the level of effort as an argument to the method
or routine that adds a MIP start to a model or that modifies a MIP
start. When CPLEX writes MIP starts to a file, such as a file in MST
format, CPLEX records the level of effort the user specified for each
MIP start. If you have not specified an effort level, CPLEX assigns
a default effort level.</p>
<p class="p">Here are the levels of effort and their effect:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Level 1: CPLEX checks <strong class="ph b">feasibility</strong> of
the corresponding MIP start. This level requires you to provide values
for <strong class="ph b">all</strong> variables in the problem, both discrete and
continuous. If any values are missing, CPLEX does not process this
MIP start.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Level 2: CPLEX solves the <strong class="ph b">fixed
LP</strong> problem specified by the MIP start. This effort level requires
you to provide values for all <strong class="ph b">discrete</strong> variables.
If values for any discrete variables are missing, CPLEX does not process
the MIP start. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Level 3: CPLEX solves a subMIP. You must
specify the value of at least one discrete variable at this effort
level. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Level 4: CPLEX attempts to repair the MIP
start if it is infeasible, according to the parameter that sets the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/RepairTries.html" title="Limits the attempts to repair an infeasible MIP start.">number of attempts to repair infeasible MIP start</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">RepairTries</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REPAIRTRIES</samp>). You must specify the value
of at least one discrete variable at this effort level, too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">You may specify a different level of effort for each
MIP start, for example, differing levels of effort for the incumbent,
for a MIP start corresponding to a solution in the solution pool,
for a MIP start supplied by the user. By <strong class="ph b">default</strong>,
CPLEX expends effort at level 4 for the first MIP start and at level
1 (one) for other MIP starts. You may change that level of effort;
you do so by means of an argument to the method or routine when you
add a MIP start to a model or when you modify the MIP start.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__section1219737626118"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MIP starts
and repair tries</h2><p class="p">If the values specified in your
MIP start do not lead directly to an integer-feasible solution, CPLEX
applies a heuristic to try to repair the MIP start. The number of
times that CPLEX attempts to repair a MIP start is controlled by a
parameter, the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/RepairTries.html" title="Limits the attempts to repair an infeasible MIP start.">number of attempts to repair infeasible MIP start</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">RepairTries</samp> in
Concert Technology, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REPAIRTRIES</samp> in
the Callable Library). If this process succeeds, the solution will
be treated as an integer solution of the current problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__oTsHcX1T"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MIP starts and the
solution pool</h2><p class="p">If you are solving a sequence of
problems, for example, by modifying and re-solving the model, CPLEX
creates a MIP start corresponding to the incumbent and to each member
of the solution pool. You may add other MIP starts which you have
computed. CPLEX then automatically processes all of these MIP starts,
unless you have turned off MIP starts by setting that parameter to
0 (zero). For documentation of the MIP start parameter (<samp class="ph codeph">AdvInd</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_ADVIND</samp>) see <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/AdvInd.html" title="If set to 1 or 2, this parameter specifies that CPLEX should use advanced starting information when it initiates optimization.">advanced start switch</a> in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX

</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.638620__section1218614208185"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MIP starts
and the Interactive Optimizer</h2><p class="p">To write a particular
MIP start to a file from the Interactive Optimizer, use the <samp class="ph codeph">write</samp> command supplying the file name, the file
extension for MST formatted files, and the identifier of the MIP start,
like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>write filename.mst id</code></pre>
<p class="p">The identifier of the MIP start may be its <strong class="ph b">name</strong> or
its <strong class="ph b">index</strong> number. In the Interactive Optimizer, MIP
starts are named by default like this: <samp class="ph codeph">m1</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">m2</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">m3</samp>, and so forth (that
is, m followed by a number). The index number of a MIP start ranges
from 1 (one) through the number of existing MIP starts for the current
problem.</p>
<p class="p">To <strong class="ph b">write all</strong> existing MIP
starts from the current session of the Interactive Optimizer to a
formatted file, use this command:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>write filename.mst all</code></pre>

of the Interactive Optimizer, use this command, where <samp class="ph codeph">id</samp> is
the name or index of the MIP start to delete:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>change delete mipstart id</code></pre>
<p class="p">To delete a range of MIP starts, supply one the conventional
