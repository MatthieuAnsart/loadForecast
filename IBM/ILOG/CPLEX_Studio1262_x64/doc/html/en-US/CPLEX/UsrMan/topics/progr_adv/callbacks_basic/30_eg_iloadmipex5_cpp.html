<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Illustrates callbacks to control cuts in the C++ API.</p>
<p class="p">This example shows how to use the cut callback in the
context of solving the <samp class="ph msgph">noswot </samp>model.
This is a relatively small model from the MIPLIB 3.0 and MIPLIB 2003
test-sets, consisting only of 128 variables. This model is very hard
to solve by itself. In fact, until the release of CPLEX version 6.5,
it appeared to be unsolvable even after days of computation. </p>
<p class="p">While it is now solvable directly, the computation time
is still substantial. However, cuts can be derived, the addition of
which make the problem solvable in a matter of minutes or seconds.
These cuts, expressed as pseudo C++, look like this: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>x21 - x22 &lt;= 0
x22 - x23 &lt;= 0
x23 - x24 &lt;= 0
2.08*x11 + 2.98*x21 + 3.47*x31 + 2.24*x41 + 2.08*x51 +
0.25*w11 + 0.25*w21 + 0.25*w31 + 0.25*w41 + 0.25*w51 &lt;= 20.25
2.08*x12 + 2.98*x22 + 3.47*x32 + 2.24*x42 + 2.08*x52 +
0.25*w12 + 0.25*w22 + 0.25*w32 + 0.25*w42 + 0.25*w52 &lt;= 20.25
2.08*x13 + 2.98*x23 + 3.47*x33 + 2.24*x43 + 2.08*x53 +
0.25*w13 + 0.25*w23 + 0.25*w33 + 0.25*w43 + 0.25*w53 &lt;= 20.25
2.08*x14 + 2.98*x24 + 3.47*x34 + 2.24*x44 + 2.08*x54 +
0.25*w14 + 0.25*w24 + 0.25*w34 + 0.25*w44 + 0.25*w54 &lt;= 20.25
2.08*x15 + 2.98*x25 + 3.47*x35 + 2.24*x45 + 2.08*x55 +
0.25*w15 + 0.25*w25 + 0.25*w35 + 0.25*w45 + 0.25*w55 &lt;= 16.25
</code></pre>
<p class="p">These cuts derive from an interpretation of the model
as a resource allocation problem on five machines with scheduling,
horizon constraints and transaction times. The first three cuts break
symmetries among the machines, while the others capture minimum bounds
on transaction costs. For more information about how these cuts were
found, see the technical research report <em class="ph i">MIP
Theory and Practice: Closing the Gap</em>.</p>
<p class="p">Of course the best way to solve the <samp class="ph msgph">noswot</samp> model
with these cuts is to simply add the cuts to the model before calling
the optimizer. In case you want to copy and paste those cuts into
a model in the <strong class="ph b">Interactive Optimizer</strong>,
for example, here are the same cuts expressed in the conventions of
the Interactive Optimizer with uppercase variable names, as in the
MPS data file:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>X21 - X22 &lt;= 0

<p class="p">However, for demonstration purposes, this example adds
the cuts, using a cut callback, only when they are violated at a node.
This cut callback takes a list of cuts as an argument and adds individual
cuts whenever they are violated by the current LP solution. Notice
that adding cuts does not change the extracted model, but affects
only the internal problem representation of the CPLEX object. </p>
<p class="p">First consider the C++ implementation of the callback.
In C++, the callback is implemented with these lines: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILOUSERCUTCALLBACK3(CtCallback, IloExprArray, lhs, IloNumArray, rhs, IloNum, eps) {
   IloInt n = lhs.getSize();
   for (IloInt i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
      IloNum xrhs = rhs[i];
      if ( xrhs &lt; IloInfinity  &amp;&amp;  getValue(lhs[i]) &gt; xrhs + eps ) {
         IloRange cut;
         try {
            cut = (lhs[i] &lt;= xrhs);
            add(cut).end();
            rhs[i] = IloInfinity;
         }
         catch (...) {
            cut.end();
            throw;
         }
      }
   }
}</code></pre>
<p class="p">This defines the class <samp class="ph codeph">CtCallbackI</samp> as
a derived class of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::UserCutCallbackI</samp> and
provides the implementation for its virtual methods <samp class="ph codeph">main</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">duplicateCallback</samp> .
It also implements a function <samp class="ph codeph">CtCallback</samp> that
creates an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">CtCallbackI</samp> and
returns a handle for it, an instance of<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::UserCutCallback</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">As specified by the <samp class="ph codeph">3 </samp>in the
macro name, the constructor of <samp class="ph codeph">CtCallbackI</samp> 
takes three arguments: <samp class="ph codeph">lhs</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">rhs</samp>,
and <samp class="ph codeph">eps</samp> (lefthand side, righthand side,
and tolerance). The constructor stores them as private members to
have direct access to them in the callback function, implemented as
the method <samp class="ph codeph">main</samp>. Notice the comma (,) between
the type and the argument object in the macro invocation. Here is
how the macro expands with ellipsis (...) representing the actual
implementation </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>class CtCallbackI : public IloCplex::LazyConstraintCallbackI {
    IloExprArray lhs;
    IloNumArray rhs;
    IloNum eps;

         IloCplex::LazyConstraintCallbackI(env), lhs(xx1), rhs(xx2), eps(xx3) {
    }
    void main();
};
IloCplex::Callback
CtCallback(IloEnv env, IloExprArray lhs, IloNumArray rhs, IloNum eps) {
    return (IloCplex::Callback(new(env) CtCallbackI(env, lhs, rhs, eps)));
}
void CtCallbackI::main() {
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p class="p"> : </p>
<p class="p">Similar macros are provided for other numbers of arguments
ranging from 0 through 7 for all callback classes. </p>
<p class="p">The first argument <samp class="ph codeph">lhs</samp>  is
an array of expressions, and the argument <samp class="ph codeph">rhs</samp> 
is an array of values. These arguments are the lefthand side and righthand
side values of cuts of the form <samp class="ph codeph">lhs </samp> ≤<samp class="ph codeph"> rhs</samp> 
to be tested for violation and potentially added. The third argument <samp class="ph codeph">eps</samp> 
gives a tolerance by which a cut must at least be violated in order
to be added to the problem being solved.</p>
<p class="p">The implementation of this example cut-callback looks
for cuts that are violated by the current LP solution of the node
where the callback is invoked. It loops over the potential cuts, checking
each for violation by querying the value of the <samp class="ph codeph">lhs</samp> 
expression with respect to the current solution. This query calls <samp class="ph codeph">getValue</samp> with
this expression as an argument. This value is tested for violation
of more than the tolerance argument <samp class="ph codeph">eps</samp> 
with the corresponding righthand side value. </p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> <p class="p">A numeric tolerance is always a wise thing to consider
when dealing with any nontrivial model, to avoid certain logical inconsistencies
that could otherwise occur due to numeric round-off. Here the standard
simplex feasibility tolerance serves this purpose, to make sure there
is consistency with the way CPLEX is treating the rest of the model. </p>
</div>
<p class="p">If a violation is detected, the callback creates an <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> 
object to represent the cut:<samp class="ph codeph"> lhs[i] </samp> ≤<samp class="ph codeph"> rhs[i]</samp>.
It is added to the LP by the method <samp class="ph codeph">add</samp>.
Adding a cut to CPLEX, unlike extracting a model, only copies the
cut into the CPLEX data structures, without maintaining a notification
link between the two. Thus, after a cut has been added, it can be
deleted by calling its method <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp>. In fact,
it should be deleted, as otherwise the memory used for the cut could
not be reclaimed. For convenience, the method <samp class="ph codeph">add</samp> returns
the cut that has been added, and thus the application can call <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> directly
on the returned <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> object.</p>
<p class="p">It is important that all resources that have been allocated
during a callback are freed again before leaving the callback, even
in the case of an exception. Here exceptions could be thrown when
the cut itself is created or when the application tries to add it,
for example, due to memory exhaustion. Thus, these operations are
enclosed in a <samp class="ph codeph">try</samp> block to catch all exceptions
that may occur. In the case of an exception, the cut is deleted by
a call to <samp class="ph codeph">cut.end</samp> and whatever exception
was caught is then re-thrown. Re-throwing the exception can be omitted
if you want to continue the optimization without the cut.</p>
<p class="p">After the cut has been added, the application sets the <samp class="ph codeph">rhs</samp> 
value at <samp class="ph codeph">IloInfinity</samp>  to avoid checking
this cut for violation at the next invocation of the callback. Note
that it did not simply remove the <em class="ph i">i</em> <sup class="ph sup">th</sup> element
of arrays <samp class="ph codeph">rhs</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">lhs</samp>,
because doing so is not supported if the cut callback is invoked from
a parallel optimizer. However, changing array elements is allowed.</p>
<p class="p">Also, for the potential use of the callback in parallel,
the variable <samp class="ph codeph">xrhs</samp>  makes sure that the
same value is used when checking for violation of the cut as when
adding the cut. Otherwise, another thread may have set the <samp class="ph codeph">rhs</samp> 
value to <samp class="ph codeph">IloInfinity</samp> just between the two
actions, and a useless cut would be added. CPLEX would actually handle
this correctly, as it handles adding the same cut from different threads.</p>
<p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">makeCuts</samp> generates
the arrays <samp class="ph codeph">rhs</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">lhs</samp> to
be passed to the cut callback. It first declares the array of variables
to be used for defining the cuts. Since the environment is not passed
to the constructor of that array, an array of 0-variable handles is
created. In the following loop, these variable handles are initialized
to the correct variables in the <samp class="ph msgph">noswot</samp> 
model which are passed to this function as the argument <samp class="ph codeph">vars</samp>.
Variables are identified by querying their names. After all the variables
have been assigned, they are used to create the <samp class="ph codeph">lhs</samp> expressions
and <samp class="ph codeph">rhs</samp> values of the cuts.</p>
<p class="p">The cut callback is created and passed to CPLEX in this
line:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cplex.use(CtCallback(env, lhs, rhs, cplex.getParam(IloCplex::EpRHS)));</code></pre>
<p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">CtCallback</samp> constructs
an instance of our callback class <samp class="ph codeph">CtCallbackI</samp> and
returns a handle (an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::Callback</samp>)
for it. This handle is directly passed to the function <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.use</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Java</strong> implementation
of the callback is quite similar: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   public static class Callback extends IloCplex.UserCutCallback {
      double     eps = 1.0e-6;
      IloRange[] cut;
      Callback(IloRange[] cuts) { cut = cuts; }

      public void main() throws IloException {
         int num = cut.length;
         for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; ++i) {
            IloRange thecut = cut[i];
            if ( thecut != null ) {
               double val = getValue(thecut.getExpr());
               if ( thecut.getLB() &gt; val+eps || val-eps &gt; thecut.getUB() ) {
                  add(thecut);
                  cut[i] = null;
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }</code></pre>
<p class="p">Instead of receiving expressions and righthand side values,
the application directly passes an array of <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> 
constraints to the callback; the constraints are stored in <samp class="ph codeph">cut</samp> .
The <samp class="ph codeph">main</samp>  loops over all cuts and evaluates
the constraint expressions at the current solution by calling <samp class="ph codeph">getValue(cut[i].getExpr)</samp>.
If this value exceeds the constraint bounds by more than the tolerance
of <samp class="ph codeph">eps</samp>, the cut is added during the search
by a call to <samp class="ph codeph">add(cut[i])</samp>, and <samp class="ph codeph">cut[i]</samp> is
set to <samp class="ph codeph">null</samp> in order to avoid unnecessarily
evaluating it again.</p>
<p class="p">As for the C++ implementation, the array of cuts passed
to the callback is initialized in a separate function <samp class="ph codeph">makeCuts</samp> .
The callback is then created and used to with the <samp class="ph codeph">noswot</samp> 
cuts by calling. </p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> provides an easier
way to manage such cuts in a case like this, where all cuts can be
easily enumerated before starting the optimization. Calling the methods <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.addCut</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.addCuts</samp> allows
you to copy the cuts to <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> before
the optimization. Thus, instead of creating and using the callback,
a user could have written:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>makeCuts(cuts, vars);
cplex.addUserCuts(cuts);</code></pre>
<p class="p">as shown in the example <samp class="ph codeph">iloadmipex4.cpp</samp> in
the distribution. During branch &amp; cut, CPLEX considers
adding individual cuts to its representation of the model only if
they are violated by a node LP solution in about the same way this
example handles them. Whether this approach or adding the cuts directly
to the model gives better performance during the solution of the model
depends on the individual problem.</p>
