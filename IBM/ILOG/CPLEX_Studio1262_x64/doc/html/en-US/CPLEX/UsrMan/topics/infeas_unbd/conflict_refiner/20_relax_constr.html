<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains the effect of relaxing a constraint in the model.</p>
<p class="p">How much is it costing to maintain this rule? Consider
asking them to work productively pairwise, if not all three, and relax
the upper limit of this constraint, like this:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>change rhs c9 2
optimize</code></pre>
<p class="p">The model is now restored to feasibility, and the new
optimum has an overall cost of 310, a tangible improvement of 25 over
the previous optimum, using employees {2,3,5,6,8,10}; employee 7 has
been removed in favor of employee 8. Is that enough monetary benefit
to offset whatever reasons there were for separating employees 4 and
8? That is not a decision that can be made here; but at least this
model provides some quantitative basis toward making that decision.
Additionally, a check of the <samp class="ph codeph">service</samp>  variable
shows that its solution value is back up to 3.2, a further benefit
from relaxing constraint c9. Perhaps this decision should have been
made sooner, the first time constraint c9 appeared in a conflict.</p>
<p class="p">The solution of 310 could be investigated further by
changing the upper bound of <samp class="ph codeph">cost</samp>  to be
305, for example. The conflict resulting from this change consists
of the skills constraint plus the constraint requiring at least one
manager on duty. At this point, the analysis has reached a conclusion,
unless management or the model formulator decides to challenge the
policy.</p>
