<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes solving quadratic programming problems (QPs) with CPLEX. </p>
<p class="p">CPLEX solves quadratic programs; that is, a model in which the constraints are 
linear, but the objective function can contain one or more quadratic terms. These 
problems are also known as QP. When such problems are convex, CPLEX normally solves them 
efficiently in polynomial time. Nonconvex QPs, however, are known to be quite hard. 
In theoretical terms, they are characterized as NP-hard. CPLEX applies various 
approaches to those problems, such approaches as barrier algorithms or branch and 
bound algorithms.  Notably, in the branch and bound approach, there is no theoretical 
guarantee about the complexity of such a problem.  Consequently, solution of such a 
problem (that is, a nonconvex QP) can take many orders of magnitude longer than the 
solution of a convex QP of comparable dimensions. The following topics address 
the question of how to distinguish such problems and describe the facilities that 
CPLEX offers to solve them.</p>
