<h1 class="title topictitle1">Diagnosing unboundedness</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains typical messages related to unboundedness and
suggests ways to access further information.</p>
<p class="p">You may be able to diagnose the cause of unboundedness by examining
the output from the optimizer that detected the unboundedness. For
example, if the preprocessing at the beginning of optimization made
a series of reductions and then stopped with a message like this:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">Primal unbounded due to dual bounds, variable 'x1'.</samp> </p>
<p class="p">it makes sense to look at your formulation, paying particular attention
to variable <samp class="ph codeph">x1</samp> and its interactions. Perhaps <samp class="ph codeph">x1</samp> never
intersects less-than-or-equal-to constraints with a positive coefficient
(or, greater-than-or-equal-to constraints with a negative coefficient),
and by inspection you can see that nothing prevents <samp class="ph codeph">x1</samp> 
from going to infinity. </p>
<p class="p">Similarly, the primal simplex optimizer may terminate with a message
like this:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">Diverging variable = x2</samp> </p>
<p class="p">In such a case, you should focus attention on <samp class="ph codeph">x2</samp>.
(The dual simplex and barrier optimizers work differently than primal;
they do not detect unboundedness in this way.) Unfortunately, the
variable which is reported in one of these ways may or may not be
a direct cause of the unboundedness, because of the many algebraic
manipulations performed by the optimizer along the way.</p>
<p class="p">An approach to diagnosis that is related to the technique discussed
in <a class="xref" href="03_avoid.html" title="Suggests ways to eliminate unboundedness from a model.">Avoiding unboundedness in a model</a> is to temporarily
assign finite bounds to all variables. By solving the modified model
and discovering which variables have solution values at these artificial
bounds, you may be able to trace the cause through the constraints
involving those variables.</p>
<p class="p">Since an unbounded outcome means that an unbounded ray exists,
one approach to diagnosis is to display this ray. In <strong class="ph b">Concert Technology</strong>,
use the method <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html#getRay" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">getRay</a>; in the <strong class="ph b">Callable
Library</strong> use the advanced routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/getray.html" title="The routine CPXXgetray/CPXgetray finds an unbounded direction (also known as a ray) for a linear program where the CPLEX simplex optimizer concludes that the LP is unbounded (solution status CPX_STAT_UNBOUNDED).">CPXgetray</a></samp>.
The relationship of the variables in this ray may give you guidance
as to the cause of unboundedness.</p>
<p class="p">If you are familiar with LP theory, then you might consider transforming
your model to the associated dual formulation. This transformation
can be accomplished, for example, by writing out the model in DUA
format and then reading it back in.  (See the <em class="ph i">CPLEX File Formats
Reference Manual</em> for a brief description of DUA as a file format.)
 </p>
<div class="p">Another way to transform your model to its associated dual formulation
is first to enter your model in the Interactive Optimizer and then
to use the following series of commands to write out the dual formulation
of your model to a file in PRE format. <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>set preprocessing dual 1      \\ presolve the primal and pass the dual to the optimizer
set preprocessing presolve 0  \\ turn off presolve
set preprocessing reduce 0    \\no primal or dual reductions
write dual.pre  </code></pre>
 </div>
<p class="p">The dual model of an unbounded model will be infeasible. And that
means that you can use the conflict refiner to reduce the infeasible
model to a minimal conflict. (See <a class="xref" href="../conflict_refiner/01_ref_confl_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes the conflict refiner, a feature for diagnosing the cause of infeasibility in a model, whether continuous or discrete, whether linear or quadratic.">Diagnosing infeasibility by refining conflicts</a> for
more about the conflict refiner.) It is possible that the smaller
model will allow you to identify the source of the (dual) infeasibility
more easily than the full model allows.</p>
