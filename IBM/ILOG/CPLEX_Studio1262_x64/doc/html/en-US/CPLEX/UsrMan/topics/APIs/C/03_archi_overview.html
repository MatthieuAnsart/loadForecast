<h1 class="title topictitle1">Overview</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Offers general remarks and a diagram of the architecture
of a Callable Library application.</p>
<p class="p">IBM ILOG CPLEX
includes a callable C library that makes it possible to develop applications
to optimize, to modify, and to interpret the results of mathematical
programming problems whether linear, mixed integer, or convex quadratic
ones.</p>
<p class="p">You can use the Callable Library to write applications
that conform to many modern computer programming paradigms, such as
client-server applications within distributed environments, multithreaded
applications running on multiple processors, applications linked to
database managers, or applications using flexible graphic user interface
builders, just to name a few.</p>
<p class="p">The Callable Library together with the CPLEX database
make up the CPLEX core, as you see in <a class="xref" href="03_archi_overview.html#wrZw5Ps2__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.658877">Figure 1</a>. The CPLEX database
includes the computing environment, its communication channels, and
your problem objects. You will associate the core with your application
by calling library routines.</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="wrZw5Ps2__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.658877"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. A view of the Callable Library</span><div class="image"><img class="image" src="../../../images/callableLibraryf.gif" alt="callableLibraryf.gif" /></div></div>
<p class="p">The Callable Library itself contains routines organized
into several categories:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> <em class="ph i">problem
modification routines</em> let you define a problem and
change it after you have created it within the CPLEX database;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">optimization routines enable you to
optimize a problem and generate results;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">utility routines handle application
programming issues;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">problem query routines access information
about a problem after you have created it;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">file reading and writing routines move
information from the file system of your operating system into your
application, or from your application into the file system;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">parameter routines enable you to query,
set, or modify parameter values maintained by CPLEX.</p>
</li>
</ul>
