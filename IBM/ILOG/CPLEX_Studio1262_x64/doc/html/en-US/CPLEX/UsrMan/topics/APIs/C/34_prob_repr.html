<h1 class="title topictitle1">Problem representation</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes how to represent the problem by means of the
C API.</p>
<p class="p">The problem contains a set of foods, which are the modeling
variables; a set of nutritional requirements to be satisfied, which
are the constraints; and an objective of minimizing the total cost
of the food. There are two ways to look at this problem:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The problem can be modeled in a row-wise
fashion, by entering the variables first and then adding the constraints
on the variables and the objective function.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The problem can be modeled in a column-wise
fashion, by constructing a series of empty constraints and then inserting
the variables into the constraints and the objective function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The diet problem is equally suited for both kinds of
modeling. In fact you can even mix both approaches in the same program:
If a new food product is introduced, you can create a new variable
for it, regardless of how the model was originally built. Similarly,
is a new nutrient is discovered, you can add a new constraint for
it.</p>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.650743__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.650749"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Creating a model row by row</h2><p class="p">You walk into the store and compile a list of foods that
are offered. For each food, you store the price per unit and the amount
they have in stock. For some foods that you particularly like, you
also set a minimum amount you would like to use in your diet. Then
for each of the foods you create a modeling variable to represent
the quantity to be purchased for your diet. </p>
<p class="p">Now you get a medical book and look up which nutrients
are known and relevant for you. For each nutrient, you note the minimum
and maximum amount that should be found in your diet. Also, you go
through the list of foods and decide how much a food item will contribute
for each nutrient. This gives you one constraint per nutrient, which
can naturally be represented as a range constraint </p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">nutrmin[i]  ≤ ∑</samp> <sub class="ph sub">j</sub> <samp class="ph codeph">(nutrper[i][j]
* buy[j])</samp>  ≤ <samp class="ph codeph">nutrmax[i]</samp>  </p>
<p class="p">where <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>  represents the index
of the nutrient under consideration, <samp class="ph codeph">nutrmin[i]</samp> 
and <samp class="ph codeph">nutrmax[i]</samp>  the minimum and maximum
amount of nutrient <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>  and <samp class="ph codeph">nutrper[i][j]</samp> 
the amount of nutrient <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>  in food <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp> .
Finally, you specify your objective function to minimize, like this: </p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">cost = ∑</samp> <sub class="ph sub">j</sub> <samp class="ph codeph">(cost[j]
* buy[j])</samp> </p>
<p class="p">This way to create the model is shown in function <samp class="ph codeph">populatebyrow</samp> 
in example <samp class="ph codeph">diet.c</samp> .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.650743__User_manual.uss_callableLibrary.650758"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Creating a model column by column</h2><p class="p">You start with the medical book where you compile the
list of nutrients that you want to make sure are properly represented
in your diet. For each of the nutrients, you create an empty constraint:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">nutrmin[i] </samp> ≤<samp class="ph codeph"> ... </samp> ≤<samp class="ph codeph"> nutrmax[i]</samp>  </p>
<p class="p">where <samp class="ph codeph">...</samp>  is left to be filled
after you walk into your store. You also set up the objective function
to minimize the cost. Constraint <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>  is
referred to as <samp class="ph codeph">rng[i]</samp>  and the objective
is referred to as <samp class="ph codeph">cost</samp> . </p>
<p class="p">Now you walk into the store and, for each food, you check
its price and nutritional content. With this data you create a variable
representing the amount you want to buy of the food type and install
it in the objective function and constraints. That is you create the
following column: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  IloObjective obj = cplex.objective(sense, expr, name);
cplex.setParam(IloCplex.IntParam.PPriInd,
                IloCplex.PrimalPricing.Steep);
IloColumn col = cplex.column(obj, 1.0).and(cplex.column(rng, 2.0));
cost(foodCost[j]) "+" "sum_i" (rng[i](nutrper[i][j])) </code></pre>
<p class="p">where the notation "<samp class="ph codeph">+</samp> " and
"<samp class="ph codeph">sum</samp> " indicates that you “add”
the new variable <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp>  to the objective <samp class="ph codeph">cost</samp> 
and constraints <samp class="ph codeph">rng[i]</samp> . The value in parentheses
is the linear coefficient that is used for the new variable.</p>
<p class="p">Here’s another way to visualize a column, such
as column j in this example:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>foodCost[j]
nutrper[0][j]
nutrper[1][j]
...
nutrper[m-1][j]</code></pre>
