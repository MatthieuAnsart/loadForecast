<h1 class="title topictitle1">Avoiding unboundedness in a model</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Suggests ways to eliminate unboundedness from a model.</p>
<p class="p">Unboundedness can be viewed as an under-constrained condition;
such an outcome may result from a modeler forgetting to include one
or more constraints in the model. Therefore, carefully checking that
your problem formulation is complete is a good first step in diagnosing
unboundedness.</p>
<p class="p">The default variable type in CPLEX has a lower bound
of 0 (zero) and an upper bound of infinity. If you declare a variable
to be of type <samp class="ph codeph">Free</samp>, its lower bound is
negative infinity instead of 0 (zero). A model can not be unbounded
unless one or more of the variables has either of these infinite bounds.
Therefore, one straightforward tactic in avoiding unboundedness is
to assign finite bounds to every variable in your model. In other
words, if no variable can go on an unbounded ray to infinity, then
your model can not be unbounded. </p>
<p class="p">Other forms of avoiding under-constrained conditions,
such as adding a constraint that limits the sum of all variables,
are also possible.</p>
<p class="p">If an unbounded solution is not possible in the physical
system you are modeling, then adding finite lower and upper bounds
or adding other constraints may represent something realistic about
the system that is worth expressing in the model anyway. However,
great care should be taken to assign meaningful bounds, in cases where
it is not possible to be certain what the actual bounds should be.
If you happen to select bounds that are tighter than an optimal solution
would obtain, then you can get a solution with a worse value of the
objective function than you want. On the other hand, picking extremely
large numbers for bounds (just to be safe) carries some risk, too:
on a finite-precision computer, even a bound of one billion may introduce
numeric instability and cause the optimizer to solve less rapidly
or not to converge to a solution at all, or may result in solutions
that satisfy tolerances but contain small infeasibilities.</p>
