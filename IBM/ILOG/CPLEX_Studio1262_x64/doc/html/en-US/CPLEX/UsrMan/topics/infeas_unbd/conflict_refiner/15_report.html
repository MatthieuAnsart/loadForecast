<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains lower bounds reported in a conflict by the conflict
refiner.</p>
<p class="p">The constraints mentioned by presolve are part of the
minimal conflict detected by the conflict refiner. The additional
information provided by this conflict is that the lower bound on service
quality could also be considered for modification to achieve feasibility:
with only one among employees 4, 5, and 8 permitted, any of whom contribute
0.5 to the quality metric, the lower bound on <samp class="ph codeph">service</samp> 
can not be achieved. Unlike a binary variable, where it would make
little sense to adjust either of its bounds to achieve feasibility,
the bounds on a continuous variable like <samp class="ph codeph">service</samp> 
may be worth scrutiny. </p>
<p class="p">The other information this Conflict provides is that
no change of the upper bound on <samp class="ph codeph">service</samp>,
currently infinity, could aid toward feasibility; perhaps that is
already obvious, but even a finite upper bound would not be part of
this conflict (as long as it is larger than the lower bound of 3.2). </p>
