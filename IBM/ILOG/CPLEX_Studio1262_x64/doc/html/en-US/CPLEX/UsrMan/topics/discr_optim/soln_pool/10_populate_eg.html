<p class="p">In that log, you see that the procedure executed its
first and second phases. It reports parameter settings, such as MIP
emphasis, like other optimization logs. It also reports how many solutions
it found. It stops when it reaches the populate limit. (In this example,
the populate limit rests at its default, 20 solutions.)</p>
<p class="p">Interestingly, the gap printed in that log becomes negative
in the second phase of populate. At the end of the first phase of
populate, the model was solved to optimality; the best node value
and the best integer value coincided and were equal to the optimal
objective value; the gap was zero. Early in the second phase, the
best integer value remained equal to the optimal objective value,
but as populate progressed, nodes were explored and fathomed. At some
point, all nodes with a relaxation value equal to the optimal objective
value were fathomed. This fathoming explains why the best node value
increased above the optimal objective value (for a minimization problem,
such as this example) as the search space was explored in the second
phase. Recall that the gap value is computed as:</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">(bestInteger-bestBound)*objSense/(abs(bestInteger)+1e-10)</samp></p>
<p class="p">Consequently, the gap can become negative. A negative
gap value ( <samp class="ph codeph">-g%</samp> ) indicates that the search
space explored by populate does not contain any more solutions that
are less than <samp class="ph codeph">g%</samp>  worse than the optimal
objective value.</p>
<p class="p">You can invoke the populate procedure multiple times.
In successive invocations, it will re-use information it has accumulated
in previous invocations. For example, if you then immediately invoke
populate a second time on this model, it re-uses the information it
gathered in the previous invocation to resume its second phase, like
this:  </p>

<p class="p">The status line of both invocations of populate indicates
that the optimal solution of the model has been found. Nevertheless,
populate continues to produce solutions: optimality is not the stopping
criterion for populating the solution pool. For more detail about
