<h1 class="title topictitle1">Changing problem type in a QCP</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains considerations about changing the problem type
in a quadratically constrained program, according to CPLEX components.</p>
<p class="p">By default, every model in <strong class="ph b">Concert Technology</strong> is
the most general problem type possible. Consequently, it is not necessary
to declare the problem type nor to change the problem type, even if
you add quadratic constraints to the model or remove them from it. </p>
<p class="p">In contrast, both the <strong class="ph b">Callable Library</strong> and
the <strong class="ph b">Interactive Optimizer</strong> need
for you to specify a change in problem type explicitly if you remove
the quadratic constraints that make your model a QCP.</p>
<p class="p">In both the Callable Library and Interactive Optimizer,
if you want to remove the quadratic constraints in order to solve
the problem as an LP or a QP, then you must change the problem
type, just as you would, for example, if you removed the quadratic
coefficients from a quadratic objective function. </p>
<p class="p">From the Callable Library, use the routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXchgprobtype</samp> 
to change the problem type to <samp class="ph codeph">CPXPROB_LP</samp> 
if you remove the quadratic constraints from your model in order to
solve it as an LP. Contrariwise, if you want to add quadratic constraints
to an LP or a QP model and then solve it as a QCP, use the routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXchgprobtype</samp> 
to change the problem type to <samp class="ph codeph">CPXPROB_QCP</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">When using the Interactive Optimizer, you apply the command <samp class="ph codeph">change
problem</samp>  with one of the following options:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">lp</samp>  specifies
that you want CPLEX to treat the problem as an LP. This change in
the problem type removes all the quadratic information from your problem,
if there is any present.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">qp</samp>  specifies
that you want CPLEX to treat the problem as a QP (that is, a problem
with a quadratic objective). This choice removes the quadratic constraints,
if there were any in the model.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">qcp</samp>  specifies
that you want CPLEX to treat the problem as a QCP. </p>
</li>
</ul>
