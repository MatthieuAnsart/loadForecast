<h1 class="title topictitle1">Concurrent optimizer in parallel</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the concurrent optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">On a multiprocessor computer, the concurrent optimizer
launches distinct LP and QP optimizers on multiple threads, terminating
as soon as the first optimizer finishes. The first thread uses the
same strategy as the single-processor automatic setting (0 zero) of
the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/LPMETHOD.html" title="Controls which algorithm is used to solve continuous models or to solve the root relaxation of a MIP.">algorithm for continuous problems</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_LPMETHOD</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">RootAlg</samp>)
or <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/QPMETHOD.html" title="Sets which algorithm to use when the C routine CPXqpopt (or the command optimize in the Interactive Optimizer) is invoked.">algorithm for continuous quadratic optimization</a> 
(<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_QPMETHOD</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">RootAlg</samp>)
depending on the problem type. If a second thread is available, the
concurrent optimizer runs the barrier optimizer on it. </p>
<p class="p">In the presence of more than three threads (for example, on hardware with four or more processors),
the behavior of the concurrent optimizer depends on whether the parallel mode is <strong class="ph b">opportunistic</strong> or <strong class="ph b">deterministic</strong>.  
If the parallel mode is <strong class="ph b">opportunistic</strong> and a third
processor is available, the concurrent optimizer runs all three optimizers
simultaneously: dual simplex, primal simplex, and barrier. All further
available threads are devoted to making the barrier optimization parallel. In contrast,
if the parallel mode is <strong class="ph b">deterministic</strong> (the default mode) and more than two threads are available, 
then the concurrent optimizer runs the dual simplex and barrier optimizers simultaneously 
and applies all additional threads to making the barrier optimizer parallel.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LP with large aspect ratio</h2>
<p class="p">When the concurrent optimizer is invoked on a linear program (LP), 
it checks the aspect ratio of the model. If the aspect ratio is large, 
and if more than 10 (ten) threads are available to CPLEX, then 
concurrent optimization also invokes sifting on the LP. For more 
information about sifting, see the topic 
<a class="xref" href="../../cont_optim/simplex/10_sifting.html" title="Describes conditions favoring the sifting optimizer.">Sifting optimizer</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_parallel.1042173__waydejAR"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Finishing first: basis solution in concurrent optimization</h2><p class="p">Barrier optimization is not considered complete until
the crossover step has been performed and simplex re-optimization
has converged; in other words, regardless of which optimizer turns
out to be the fastest, the concurrent optimizer always returns a basis
solution at optimality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_parallel.1042173__zlXYKkl5"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Performance trade-offs in concurrent optimization</h2><p class="p">The concurrent optimizer requires more memory than any
individual optimizer, and of course it adds system load by consuming
more aggregate CPU time than the fastest individual optimizer would
alone. However, the advantages offered in terms of robust solution
of models, and assurance in most cases of the minimum solution time,
will make it attractive in many situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_parallel.1042173__Kq14cJbr"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Interpreting the log in concurrent optimization</h2><p class="p">When you invoke concurrent optimization in your application,
you may observe a point in the log when CPLEX® reports a solution
of the model by an optimizer, but no other report of activity appears
in the log for a considerable time afterward. During this apparently
inactive period, concurrent optimization deterministically manages
potential race conditions among competing optimizers. Among other
decisions during this period, the concurrent optimizer decides deterministically
from which of those competing optimizers to accept the final solution.</p>
<p class="p">If this apparent wait during the race between concurrent
optimizers poses a problem for your application, there are two alternative
remedies available to you:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Use opportunistic mode, rather than
the default deterministic mode. To do so, change the setting of the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/ParallelMode.html" title="Sets the parallel optimization mode. Possible modes are automatic, deterministic, and opportunistic.">parallel mode switch</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_PARALLELMODE</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">ParallelMode</samp>)
documented in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX Parameters
Reference Manual.</em></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Set the optimizer that consistently
solves your model first as the starting algorithm in your application.</p>

<p class="p">To do so, set the parameter appropriate for your type
of model:</p>

behavior, concurrent optimization should <strong class="ph b">not</strong> invoke
any callbacks except in the first, main thread.</p>
