<h1 class="title topictitle1">Changing variable type</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes special considerations about changing the type
of a variable in a MIP model.</p>
<p class="p">In the Interactive Optimizer, the command <samp class="ph codeph">change type</samp> 
adds (or removes) the restriction on a variable that it must be an
integer. When you enter the command <samp class="ph codeph">change type</samp> ,
the system prompts you to enter the variable that you want to change,
and then it prompts you to enter the type (<samp class="ph codeph">c</samp> 
for continuous, <samp class="ph codeph">b</samp>  for binary, <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> 
for general integer, <samp class="ph codeph">s</samp>  for semi-continuous, <samp class="ph codeph">n</samp> 
for semi-integer).</p>
<p class="p">You can change a variable to binary even if its bounds
are not 0 (zero) and 1 (one). However, in such a case, the optimizer
will change the bounds to be 0 and 1. </p>
<p class="p">If you change the type of a variable to be semi-continuous
or semi-integer, be sure to create both a lower bound and an upper
bound for it. These variable types specify that at an optimal solution
the value for the variable must be either exactly zero or else be
between the lower and upper bounds (and further subject to the restriction
that the value be an integer, in the case of semi-integer variables).</p>
<p class="p">A problem may be changed to a mixed integer problem,
even if all its variables are continuous.  </p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">It is not required to specify explicit bounds on general
integer variables. However, if during the branch-and-cut algorithm
a variable exceeds 2,100,000,000 in magnitude of its solution, an
error termination will occur. In practice, it is wise to limit integer
variables to values far smaller than the stated limit, or numeric
difficulties may occur; trying to enforce the difference between 1,000,000
and 1,000,001 on a finite precision computer might work but could
be difficult due to round-off. </p>
