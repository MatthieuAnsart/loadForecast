<h1 class="title topictitle1">Adding a constraint</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains the effect of adding a constraint to an infeasible
model.</p>
<p class="p">A natural question is why so many employees are needed.
Look for an answer by adding a constraint limiting employees to five
or fewer, like this:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>add
x1+x2+x3+x4+x5+x6+x7+x8+x9+x10 &lt;= 5
end
optimize</code></pre>
<p class="p">As you might expect, the output from the optimizer indicates
the current solution is incompatible with this new constraint, and
indeed no solution to this what-if scenario exists at all:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Warning:  MIP start values are infeasible.
Retaining MIP start values for possible repair.
Row 'c11' infeasible, all entries at implied bounds.
Presolve time =    0.00 sec.  
MIP - Integer infeasible.
Current MIP best bound is infinite.
Solution time =    0.00 sec.  Iterations = 0  Nodes = 0</code></pre>
<p class="p">Constraint c11, flagged by presolve, is the newly added
constraint, not revealing very much. To learn more about why c11 causes
trouble, run <samp class="ph codeph">conflict</samp>  again, and view
the minimal conflict with the following command again:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">display conflict all</samp>  </p>
<p class="p">You will see the following conflict: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Minimize
 obj:
Subject To
 c2:  x1 + x2 + 0.8 x3 + 0.6 x4 + 0.4 x5 &gt;= 2.1
 c3:  x6 + 0.9 x7 + 0.5 x8 &gt;= 1.2
 c4:  x9 + 0.9 x10 &gt;= 0.8
 c11: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x9 + x10 &lt;= 5
  (omitting the listing of binary variables' bounds)</code></pre>
<p class="p">The constraints in conflict with this new limitation
are all of the skill requirements. When viewed in this light, the
inconsistency is easy to spot: one employee is obviously needed for
constraint c4, two are needed for c3, and a simple calculation reveals
that three are needed for c2. Since there is no overlap in the skill
sets, five employees are too few. </p>
<p class="p">Unless management or the formulator of the model is willing
to compromise about the skills, (for example, to relax the righthand
side of any of these constraints), constraint c11 needs to be taken
out again, since it is unrealistic to get by with only five employees: </p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">change delete constraint c11</samp> </p>
<p class="p">This change results in a model with an optimal cost of
335, using six employees. </p>
