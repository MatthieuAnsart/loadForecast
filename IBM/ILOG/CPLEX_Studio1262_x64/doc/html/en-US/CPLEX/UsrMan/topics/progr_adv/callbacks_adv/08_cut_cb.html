<h1 class="title topictitle1">Cut callback</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes special considerations of the cut callback.</p>
<p class="p">The next example to consider is the user cut callback routine.
The user calls <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/setusercutcallbackfunc.html" title="The routine CPXXsetusercutcallbackfunc/CPXsetusercutcallbackfunc sets and modifies the user-written callback for adding cuts.">CPXsetusercutcallbackfunc</a></samp> to
set a user cut callback. Then CPLEX calls the user's callback routine
at every viable node of the branch &amp; cut tree. See the sample <samp class="ph codeph">admipex5.c</samp> 
for a detailed demonstration.</p>
<p class="p">A likely sequence of events after the user cut callback function
is called goes like this. First, the routine calls  <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbacknodex.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbacknodex/CPXgetcallbacknodex retrieves the primal variable (x) values for the subproblem at the current node during MIP optimization from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbacknodex</a></samp> to
get the relaxation solution for the current node. It possibly also
gathers other information about the problem (through such routines
as   <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbacklp.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbacklp/CPXgetcallbacklp retrieves the pointer to the MIP problem that is in use when the user-written callback function is called.">CPXgetcallbacklp</a></samp>, <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbackgloballb.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbackgloballb/CPXgetcallbackgloballb retrieves the best known global lower bound values during MIP optimization from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbackgloballb</a></samp>,
 and others). It then calls a user separation routine to identify
violated user cuts. These cuts are then added to the problem by a
call to <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/cutcallbackadd.html" title="The routine CPXXcutcallbackadd/CPXcutcallbackadd adds lazy constraints and globally valid cuts to the current node LP subproblem during MIP branch and cut.">CPXcutcallbackadd</a></samp>,
 and the callback returns. You can add local cuts, that is, cuts that
apply to the subtree of which the current node is the root, by means
of the routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/cutcallbackaddlocal.html" title="The routine CPXXcutcallbackaddlocal/CPXcutcallbackaddlocal adds local cuts during MIP branch and cut.">CPXcutcallbackaddlocal</a></samp>. </p>
<p class="p">CPLEX supports two rather different types of constraints that might
both be regarded as cuts in some sense. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The first type is the conventional <strong class="ph b">MIP cutting plane</strong>.
A MIP cutting plane is a constraint that can be derived from other
constraints in the problem. Equally important, a MIP cutting plane
does not cut off any integer feasible solutions. This type is known
as a user cut in CPLEX. To add a MIP cutting plane (that is, a user
cut), use the routine  <span class="keyword apiname">CPXsetusercutcallbackfunc</span>. </p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The second type is a <strong class="ph b">lazy constraint</strong>  that is, a constraint
that can not be derived from other constraints and potentially cuts
off integer feasible solutions. In other words, a lazy constraint
changes the feasible region of the model. To add a lazy constraint,
use the routine  <span class="keyword apiname">CPXsetlazyconstraintcallbackfunc</span>. </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">As with the heuristic callback, the user can choose whether to
work with presolved values or original values of the model. If the
user chooses to work with original values, a few parameters must be
modified: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> If the user adds only cutting planes to the original problem,
the user can set the advanced presolve  <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/PreLinear.html" title="Decides whether linear or full reductions occur during preprocessing.">linear reduction switch</a>  (<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_PRELINEAR</samp>)
to <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_OFF</samp>  (0). This parameter forbids certain presolve
reductions that make translation from original values to presolved
values impossible.  What happens if the user does not turn off this
parameter? If the user chooses to leave this parameter on,  it can
happen that certain user cuts cannot be  transformed into the presolved-problem
space; in that case, a call to the routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/cutcallbackadd.html" title="The routine CPXXcutcallbackadd/CPXcutcallbackadd adds lazy constraints and globally valid cuts to the current node LP subproblem during MIP branch and cut.">CPXcutcallbackadd</a></samp> to
add such a cut returns the error <span class="keyword apiname">CPXERR_PRESLV_CRUSHFORM</span>.
As user cuts are optional for solving a MIP problem,  the user can
safely ignore this error status code.  However, the user must realize
that the cut was not added  to the LP relaxation of the problem. </p>
 </li>
<li class="li"> <p class="p">If the user adds any lazy constraints, CPLEX detects the lazy
constraints and automatically turns off dual presolve reductions.
 That is, CPLEX resets two parameters. CPLEX sets the  <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/Reduce.html" title="Specifies whether primal reductions, dual reductions, both, or neither are performed during preprocessing.">primal and dual reduction type</a> 
 <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</samp> to the value <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PREREDUCE_PRIMALONLY</samp>.
CPLEX sets the presolve  <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/PreLinear.html" title="Decides whether linear or full reductions occur during preprocessing.">linear reduction switch</a>   <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_PRELINEAR</samp> to
off. Consequently,  the user must think carefully about whether constraints
added through the cut interface are implied by existing constraints
(in which case,  these additions are user cuts and thus nonlinear
reductions and  dual presolve reductions can be left on) or whether
they are not (in which case, these additions are lazy constraints
and thus nonlinear  reductions and dual presolve reductions are forbidden).</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Concert Technology users use the class   <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::LazyConstraintCallbackI</samp> 
when adding lazy constraints.  CPLEX then automatically turns off
dual reductions and nonlinear reductions.</p>
<p class="p">Concert Technology users use the class  <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::UserCutCallbackI</samp> when
adding cutting planes. In this case, CPLEX does not adjust parameters
because these parameter changes are not  required for user cuts.</p>
<p class="p">One scenario that merits special attention is when the user knows
a large set of cuts because of prior knowledge. Rather than adding
them to the original problem one by one, the user can  add them only
when they are violated. The CPLEX advanced MIP control interface provides
more than one mechanism for accomplishing this. The first and probably
most obvious at this point is to install a lazy constraint callback
that checks each of them at each node, adding those that are violated. </p>
<p class="p">Another, perhaps simpler alternative is to add them to a pool of
user cuts or lazy constraints before optimization begins. The topic
 <a class="xref" href="../usr_cut_lazy_constr/01_uc_lc_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents pools of user-defined cuts and lazy constraints.">User-cut and lazy-constraint pools</a> discusses
pools in greater detail. </p>
