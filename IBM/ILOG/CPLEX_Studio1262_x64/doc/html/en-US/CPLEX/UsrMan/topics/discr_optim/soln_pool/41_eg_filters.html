<h1 class="title topictitle1">Example: controlling properties of solutions with filters</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Illustrates filters in use in the solution pool.</p>
<p class="p">The model in <a class="xref" href="03_eg_facility_location.html" title="Describes a model used in documentation of the solution pool.">Example: simple facility location problem</a> has
two categories of variables. The <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp>  variables
specifying the facilities to open are of a higher decision level than
the <samp class="ph codeph">y</samp>  variables deciding how the goods
are shipped from facilities to regions. Suppose, for example, that
you want to populate the solution pool with solutions that differ
by which facilities are opened, without specifying any specific criteria
for the shipping decisions. The replacement strategy (shown in <a class="xref" href="35_eg_diversity.html" title="Illustrates effect on diversity of the replacement parameter of the solution pool.">Example: diverse solutions through replacement parameter</a>)
does not allow you to specify a customized diversity measure that
takes into account only a subset of the variables. However, this diversity
measure expressed only over the x variables can be enforced through
a diversity filter. </p>
<p class="p">Suppose further that facilities 1 and 2 are open. Let
a solution keeping those two facilities open be the reference; that
is, the reference value for <samp class="ph codeph">x1</samp>  is 1 (one),
for <samp class="ph codeph">x2</samp>  is 1 (one), for <samp class="ph codeph">x3</samp> 
is 0 (zero), for <samp class="ph codeph">x4</samp>  is 0 (zero).
Then use a diversity filter to stipulate that any solution added to
the solution pool must differ from the reference by decisions to open
or close at least two other facilities. The following filter file
enforces this diversity by giving each x variable a weight of 1.0
and specifying a minimum diversity of 2 and unlimited maximum diversity
(that is, infinity). In other words, this diversity filter makes sure
that solutions satisfy the following constraint:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>2 &lt;= 1.0 * |x1 - 1| + 1.0 * |x2 - 1| + 1.0 * |x3 - 0| + 1.0 * |x4 - 0|&lt;= infinity</code></pre>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">y</samp>  variables are not specified
in the filter; hence, they are not taken into account in the diversification.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>NAME location
DIVFILTER f1 2 inf
x1 1.0 1
x2 1.0 1
x3 1.0 0
x4 1.0 0
ENDATA</code></pre>
<p class="p">Range filters also enforce additional constraints. Suppose,
for example, that you want to limit transportation costs to less than
fixed costs. The following range filter enforces this restriction
by expressing the linear constraint:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">-infinity &lt;= 1.0 * transport - 1.0 * fixed &lt;=0</samp> </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>NAME location
RNGFILTER f2 -inf 0
transport 1.0
fixed -1.0
ENDATA</code></pre>
