<h1 class="title topictitle1">Changing quadratic constraints</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains special considerations about modifying a constraint
containing a quadratic term.</p>
<p class="p">To modify a quadratic constraint in your model, you must
first delete the old quadratic constraint and then add the new one.</p>
<p class="p">In <strong class="ph b">Concert Technology</strong>,
you add constraints (whether or not they are quadratic) by means of
the method <samp class="ph codeph">add</samp>  of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel</samp> ,
as explained about C++ applications in <a class="xref" href="../../APIs/Cpp/add_constr_rng.html" title="Describes the C++ classes for constraints and ranges.">Adding constraints: IloConstraint and IloRange</a> and
about Java applications in <a class="xref" href="../../APIs/Java/09_active_model.html" title="Describes the active model in the Java API.">The active model</a>.
To add constraints to a model in the .NET framework, see <a class="xref" href="../../APIs/dotNET/01_title_synopsis.html" title="Explores the features that CPLEX offers to users of C#.NET through Concert Technology.">Concert Technology for .NET users</a>.</p>
<p class="p">Also in Concert Technology, you can remove constraints
(again, whether or not they are quadratic) by means of the method <samp class="ph codeph">remove</samp> 
of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel</samp> , as explained about
C++ applications in <a class="xref" href="../../APIs/Cpp/delete_remove.html" title="Describes the effects of deleting modeling objects in the C++ API.">Deleting and removing modeling objects</a> and
about Java applications in <a class="xref" href="../../APIs/Java/34_modify_model.html" title="Describes modification of a model in the Java API.">Modifying the model</a>.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Callable Library</strong> has
a separate set of routines for creating and modifying quadratic constraints;
do not use the routines that create or modify linear constraints.</p>
<p class="p">In the Callable Library, you add a quadratic constraint
by means of the routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXaddqconstr</samp>.
You remove and delete quadratic constraints by means of the routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXdelqconstr</samp>.
Don’t forget to change the problem type, as explained in <a class="xref" href="13_prob_type_change.html" title="Explains considerations about changing the problem type in a quadratically constrained program, according to CPLEX components.">Changing problem type in a QCP</a>.
If you want to change a quadratic constraint, first delete it by calling <samp class="ph codeph">CPXdelqconstrs</samp> and
then add the new constraint using <samp class="ph codeph">CPXaddqconstr</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">Interactive Optimizer</strong>,
if you want to change a quadratic constraint, you must delete the
constraint (<samp class="ph codeph">change delete qconstraints</samp>)
and add the new constraint. Again, if you change a quadratic constraint 
to a linear constraint, you must also change the problem
type, as explained in <a class="xref" href="13_prob_type_change.html" title="Explains considerations about changing the problem type in a quadratically constrained program, according to CPLEX components.">Changing problem type in a QCP</a>.</p>
