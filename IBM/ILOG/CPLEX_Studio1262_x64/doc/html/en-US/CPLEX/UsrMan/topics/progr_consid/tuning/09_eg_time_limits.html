<body role="main" id="User_manual.uss_tuningTool.1041359">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">Examples: time limits on tuning in the Interactive Optimizer</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Shows the effect of both deterministic and nondeterministic time limits on the tuning tool in
the Interactive Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">Both overall system time limits (in seconds) and 
overall deterministic time limits (in ticks) have an impact on 
tuning. Likewise, both overall time limits and 
per-problem, per-optimization time limits also govern 
tuning. These examples in the Interactive Optimizer illustrate key points about time limits and tuning.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">First example: overall time limit and per-problem time limit in seconds</strong></p>
<p class="p">As a first example, suppose that you want to spend an overall
amount of time tuning the parameter settings for a given model, say,
1000 seconds. Also suppose that you want CPLEX to make multiple attempts
within that overall time limit to tune the parameter settings for
your model. Suppose further that you want to set a time limit on each
of those attempts, say, 200 seconds per attempt. </p>
<p class="p">In the Interactive Optimizer, first enter your model
into a session (for example, by reading a formatted file), like this:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">read model.mps</samp> </p>
<p class="p">Then set the overall time limit through the environment
with this command:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">set timelimit 1000</samp> </p>
<p class="p">That command makes 1000 seconds available as a resource
in the environment. The command effectively sets the overall time
limit (<a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/TiLim.html" title="Sets the maximum time, in seconds, for a call to an optimizer.">optimizer time limit in seconds</a>: <samp class="ph codeph">TiLim</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_TILIM</samp>). </p>
<p class="p">Then set the tuning time limit, like this: </p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">set tune timelimit 200</samp> </p>
<p class="p">This series of commands tells CPLEX to tune the parameters
of your model, making multiple attempts of 200 seconds each (set by
the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/TuningTiLim.html" title="Sets a nondeterministic time limit in seconds per model and per test set (that is, suite of models) applicable in tuning.">tuning time limit in seconds</a>: <samp class="ph codeph">TuningTiLim</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_TUNINGTILIM</samp>),
within an overall time limit of 1000 seconds (set by the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/TiLim.html" title="Sets the maximum time, in seconds, for a call to an optimizer.">optimizer time limit in seconds</a>: <samp class="ph codeph">TiLim</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_TILIM</samp>)
.</p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> Remember that system time limits in seconds lead to nondeterministic results in 
tuning, as explained in the topics  
<a class="xref" href="06_time_limits.html" title="Introduces parameters to set time limits on tuning.">Tuning and time limits</a> and 
<a class="xref" href="06_time_limits_and_determinism.html" title="Documents the effect of tuning time limits on determinism.">Tuning time limits and determinism</a>. 
If your application requires deterministic results, use deterministic time limits instead, as 
illustrated in the next example.</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Second example: overall deterministic time limit and per-problem deterministic time limit in ticks</strong></p>
<p class="p">As a second example, suppose that you want to spend an overall 
amount of time deterministically tuning the parameter settings for a given model, say, 
1000000 ticks. Also suppose that you want CPLEX to make multiple attempts
within that overall time limit to tune the parameter settings for
your model. Suppose further that you want to set a time limit on each
of those attempts, say, 200 ticks per attempt. </p>
<p class="p">In the Interactive Optimizer, as in the previous example, first enter your model
into a session (for example, by reading a formatted file), like this:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">read model.mps</samp> </p>
<p class="p">Then set the overall deterministic time limit through the environment
with this command:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">set dettimelimit 1000000</samp> </p>
<p class="p">That command makes 1000000 ticks available as a resource
in the environment. The command effectively sets the overall deterministic time
limit (<a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/DetTiLim.html" title="Deterministic time limit">deterministic time limit</a>: 
<samp class="ph codeph">DetTiLim</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_DETTILIM</samp>). </p>
<p class="p">Then set the deterministic tuning time limit, like this: </p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">set tune dettimelimit 200000</samp> </p>
<p class="p">This series of commands tells CPLEX to tune the parameters
of your model deterministically, making multiple attempts of 200000 ticks each (set by
the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/TuningDetTiLim.html" title="Sets a time limit in deterministic ticks per model and per test set (that is, suite of models) applicable in tuning.">deterministic tuning time limit</a>: 
<samp class="ph codeph">TuningDetTiLim</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_TUNINGDETTILIM</samp>),
within an overall time limit of 1000000 ticks 
(set by the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/DetTiLim.html" title="Deterministic time limit">deterministic time limit</a>: 
<samp class="ph codeph">DetTiLim</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_DETTILIM</samp>).</p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> You can use both overall time limits (both system in seconds <strong class="ph b">and</strong> deterministic in ticks) 
together; that is, you can set both <samp class="ph codeph">TiLim</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">DetTiLim</samp> 
simultaneously, as explained in the topic
<a class="xref" href="06_time_limits.html" title="Introduces parameters to set time limits on tuning.">Tuning and time limits</a>. 
However, you must <strong class="ph b">not</strong> mix a per-problem, per-optimization tuning time limit in seconds 
with a <strong class="ph b">deterministic</strong> per-problem, per-optimization tuning time limit in ticks. 
That is, do <strong class="ph b">not</strong> mix 
<samp class="ph codeph">TuningTiLim, CPX_PARAM_TUNINGTILIM</samp> with 
<samp class="ph codeph">TuningDetTiLim, CPX_PARAM_TUNINGDETTILIM</samp>, 
again as explained in 
<a class="xref" href="06_time_limits.html" title="Introduces parameters to set time limits on tuning.">Tuning and time limits</a>.</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Default behavior</strong></p>
<p class="p">At default settings, these four time limits are set to infinity (that is, 1e+75 on most platforms). 
These default settings are equivalent to setting the deterministic tuning time limit 
<samp class="ph codeph">TuningDetTiLim, CPX_PARAM_TUNINGDETTILIM</samp> 
to 1e+7.</p>
