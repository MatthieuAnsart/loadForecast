<h1 class="title topictitle1">Branch &amp; cut or dynamic search?</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the search facilities of the MIP optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">In addition to a robust branch &amp; cut algorithm,
CPLEX also offers a <em class="ph i">dynamic search
algorithm</em>. The dynamic search algorithm consists
of the same building blocks as branch &amp; cut: LP relaxation,
branching, cuts, and heuristics. The following sections of the manual
describe performance and tuning in relation to branch and cut. The
parameters mentioned in this context have a similar effect in the
dynamic search algorithm as in conventional branch and cut. In fact,
the generic description in relation to branch &amp; cut
suffices conceptually for both branch and cut and dynamic search,
even though their implementations differ. </p>
<p class="p">CPLEX offers the MIP search parameter (<a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/MIPSearch.html" title="Sets the search strategy for a mixed integer program (MIP).">MIP dynamic search switch</a>: <samp class="ph codeph">MIPSearch</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_MIPSEARCH</samp>)
for you to control whether it pursues dynamic search or conventional
branch &amp; cut in solving your problem. At its default
setting, this parameter specifies that CPLEX should choose which algorithm
to apply on the basis of characteristics it finds in your model. Other
settings allow you to specify which search to pursue.</p>
<p class="p">Because many parameter settings directly affect the branch &amp; cut
and dynamic search algorithms, here is a general description of how
branch &amp; cut is implemented within CPLEX.</p>
<p class="p">In the branch &amp; cut algorithm, CPLEX solves
a series of continuous subproblems. To manage those subproblems efficiently,
CPLEX builds a tree in which each subproblem is a node. The root of
the tree is the <em class="ph i">continuous relaxation</em> of
the original MIP problem. </p>
<p class="p">If the solution to the relaxation has one or more fractional
variables, CPLEX will try to find cuts. Cuts are constraints that
cut away areas of the feasible region of the relaxation that contain
fractional solutions. CPLEX can generate several types of cuts. (<a class="xref" href="../cuts/26_cuts_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes types of cuts available in the MIP optimizer as performance features.">Cuts</a> tells
you more about that topic.)</p>
<p class="p">If the solution to the relaxation still has one or more
fractional-valued integer variables after CPLEX tries to add cuts,
then CPLEX branches on a fractional variable to generate two new subproblems,
each with more restrictive bounds on the branching variable. For example,
with binary variables, one node will fix the variable at 0 (zero),
the other, at 1 (one).</p>
<p class="p">The subproblems may result in an all-integer solution,
in an infeasible solution, or another fractional solution. If the
solution is fractional, CPLEX repeats the process. </p>
