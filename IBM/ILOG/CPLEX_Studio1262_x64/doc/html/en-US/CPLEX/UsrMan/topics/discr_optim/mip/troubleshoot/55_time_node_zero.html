<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes remedies for excessive time spent to solve
root relaxation.</p>
<p class="p">If you observe that a very long time passes before the
search begins processing nodes, it may be that the root relaxation
problem itself is taking a long time. The standard screen display
will print a line saying "<samp class="ph codeph">Root relaxation solution time
=</samp> " after this root solve is complete, and a large solution
time would be an indicator of an opportunity for tuning. If you set
the <samp class="ph codeph">MIPDisplay</samp>  parameter to <samp class="ph codeph">4</samp> ,
you may get a further indication of the difficulties this root solve
has run into. Tuning techniques found in <a class="xref" href="../../../cont_optim/simplex/01_simplex_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents the primal and dual simplex optimizers.">Solving LPs: simplex optimizers</a>, <a class="xref" href="../../../cont_optim/qp/01_QP_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes solving quadratic programming problems (QPs) with CPLEX.">Solving problems with a quadratic objective (QP)</a>, and <a class="xref" href="../../../cont_optim/qcp/01_QCP_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents the solution of quadratically constrained programming problems (QCPs), including the special case of second order cone programming problems (SOCPs).">Solving problems with quadratic constraints (QCP)</a> are applicable to tuning the root solve of
a MIP model, too. In particular, it is worth considering setting the <samp class="ph codeph">RootAlg</samp> 
parameter to a nondefault setting, such as the barrier optimizer,
to see if a simple change in algorithm will speed up this step sufficiently.</p>
<p class="p">For some problems, CPLEX will spend a significant amount
of time performing computation at node 0, apart from solving
the continuous LP, QP, or QCP root relaxation. While this investment
of time normally saves in the overall branch &amp; cut,
it does not always do so. Time spent at node 0 can be reduced
by two parameters. </p>
<p class="p">First, you can try turning off the node heuristic by
setting the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">HeurFreq</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">-1</samp> .
Second, try a less expensive variable selection strategy by setting
the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">VarSel</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">4</samp>,
pseudo reduced costs. </p>
<p class="p">It is worth noting that setting the <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp> 
parameter to <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> , resulting in an emphasis
on feasibility instead of optimality, often also speeds up the processing
of the root node. If your purposes are compatible with this emphasis,
consider using it.</p>
