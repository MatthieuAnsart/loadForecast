<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Suggests prerequisites for using CPLEX.</p>
<p class="p">The manual assumes that you are familiar with CPLEX from
reading <em class="ph i">Getting Started with CPLEX</em> and
from following the tutorials there. Before you begin using CPLEX,
it is a good idea to read <em class="ph i">Getting
Started with CPLEX</em> and to try the tutorials in it.
It is available in the standard distribution of the product.</p>
<p class="p">In order to use CPLEX effectively, you need to be familiar
with your operating system, whether UNIX or Windows. </p>
<p class="p">This manual assumes that you are familiar with the concepts
of mathematical programming, particularly linear programming. In case
those concepts are new to you, the bibliography in <a class="xref" href="biblio.html" title="Recommends further reading about related topics.">Further reading</a> in
this preface indicates references to help you there. </p>
<p class="p">This manual also assumes you already know how to create
and manage files. In addition, if you are building an application
that uses the Component Libraries, this manual assumes that you know
how to compile, link, and execute programs written in a high-level
language. The Callable Library is written in the C programming language,
while Concert Technology is written in C++, Java, and .NET. This manual
also assumes that you already know how to program in the appropriate
language and that you will consult a programming guide when you have
questions in that area.</p>
