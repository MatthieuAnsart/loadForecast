<h1 class="title topictitle1">Deleting and removing modeling objects</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the effects of deleting modeling objects
in the C++ API.</p>
<p class="p">A special type of modification is that of deleting a modeling
object by calling its <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp>  method. Consider,
for example, the deletion of a variable. What happens if the variable
you delete has been used in constraints or in the objective function,
or has been extracted to CPLEX? If you call its <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> method,
Concert Technology carefully removes the deleted variable from all
other modeling objects and algorithms that may keep a reference to
the variable in question. This convention applies to any modeling
object to be removed. However, user-defined handles to the removed
variable are not managed by Concert Technology. Instead, it is up
to the user to make sure that these handles are not used after the
deletion of the modeling object. The only operation allowed then is
the assignment operator. </p>
<p class="p">Concert Technology also provides a way to remove a modeling
object from all other modeling objects and algorithms exactly the
same way as when deleting it, yet without deleting the modeling object:
call the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloExtractable::removeFromAll</samp>.
This method may be helpful to temporarily remove a variable (or even
an array of objects) from your model while keeping the option to add
it back later. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tip</strong>: The method <span class="keyword apiname">removeFromAll</span> is inherited
by classes derived from the class <span class="keyword apiname">IloExtractable</span>,
such classes as <span class="keyword apiname">IloObjective</span>, <span class="keyword apiname">IloConstraint</span>,
or <span class="keyword apiname">IloModel</span> and others.</p>
<p class="p">It is important to understand the difference between calling <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> and calling <samp class="ph codeph">model.remove(obj)</samp> for
an object <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp>. In the case of a call to <samp class="ph codeph">remove</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> is not necessarily
removed from the problem that CPLEX maintains. Whether or not anything
appears to happen depends on whether the removed object is referenced
by yet another extracted modeling object. For example, when you add
a modeling object, such as a ranged constraint, to a model, all the
variables used by that modeling object implicitly become part of the
model as well. However, when you remove that modeling object (for
example, that ranged constraint), those variables are not implicitly
removed because they may be referenced by other elements (such as
the objective function or a basis, for example). In other words, <samp class="ph codeph">model.add(rngct)</samp> followed
later by <samp class="ph codeph">model.remove(rngct)</samp> does not leave the model
unchanged: the model still contains the variables in <samp class="ph codeph">rngct</samp>,
even if they do not actually appear in other constraints. CPLEX does
not check whether they appear in other constraints or not when it
applies <samp class="ph codeph">remove</samp>. For that reason, variables can be
explicitly removed from a model only by a call to its <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> 
member function.</p>
<p class="p">Usually when a constraint is removed from the extracted
model, the constraint is also removed from CPLEX as well, unless it
was added to the model more than once. </p>
<p class="p">Consider the case where a variable is removed from CPLEX
after one of the <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">remove</samp> operations.
If the <samp class="ph codeph">cplex</samp> object contains a simplex basis,
by default the status for that variable is removed from the basis
as well. If the variable happens to be basic, the operation corrupts
the basis. If this is not what you want, CPLEX provides a delete mode
that first pivots the variable out of the basis before removing it.
The resulting basis is not guaranteed to be feasible or optimal, but
it will still constitute a valid basis. To select this mode, call
the method: </p>
<p class="p">  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html#setDeleteMode" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">setDeleteMode</a>(IloCplex::FixBasis); </p>
<p class="p">Similarly, when removing a constraint with the <samp class="ph codeph">FixBasis</samp> delete mode, CPLEX will pivot the corresponding
slack or artificial variable into the basis before removing it, to
make sure of maintaining a valid basis. In either case, if no valid
basis was available in the first place, no pivot operation is performed.
To set the delete mode back to its default setting, call: </p>
<p class="p">  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html#setDeleteMode" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">setDeleteMode</a> <span class="keyword apiname">(IloCplex::LeaveBasis); </span> </p>
