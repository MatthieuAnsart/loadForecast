<h1 class="title topictitle1">Differences between user cuts and lazy constraints</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Distinguishes user cuts from lazy constraints.</p>
<p class="p">Cuts may resemble ordinary constraints, but are conventionally
defined to mean those which can change the feasible space of the continuous
relaxation but do not rule out any feasible integer solution that
the rest of the model permits. A collection of cuts, therefore, involves
an element of freedom: whether or not to apply them, individually
or collectively, during the optimization of a MIP model; the formulation
of the model remains correct whether or not the cuts are included.
This degree of freedom means that if valid and necessary constraints
are mis-identified by the user and passed to CPLEX as user cuts, unpredictable
and possibly incorrect results could occur.</p>
<p class="p">By contrast, lazy constraints represent simply one portion
of the constraint set, and the model would be incomplete (and possibly
would deliver incorrect answers) in their absence. CPLEX always makes
sure that lazy constraints are satisfied before producing any solution
to a MIP model. Needed lazy constraints are also kept in effect after
the MIP optimization terminates, for example, when you change the
problem type to fixed-integer and re-optimize with a continuous optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">Another important difference between pools of user cuts
and pools of lazy constraints lies in the timing by which these pools
are applied. CPLEX may check user cuts for violation and apply them
at any stage of the optimization. Conversely, it does not guarantee
to check them at the time an integer-feasible solution candidate has
been identified. Lazy constraints are only (and always) checked when
an integer-feasible solution candidate has been identified, and of
course, any of these constraints that turn out to be violated will
then be applied to the full model.</p>
<p class="p">Cuts that are based on <strong class="ph b">optimality</strong> and that <strong class="ph b">remove</strong> 
integer feasible solutions without removing all optimal solutions 
are known as <strong class="ph b">optimality-based cuts</strong>. Optimality-based cuts 
do not fit the definition of either a user cut nor a lazy constraint. 
For example, <strong class="ph b">symmetry-breaking constraints</strong> are sometimes known as 
optimality-based cuts because symmetry-breaking constraints can remove integer 
feasible solutions without removing all optimal solutions.  
Symmetry-breaking constraints are <strong class="ph b">not</strong> user cuts in the sense addressed here. 
Symmetry-breaking constraints are not necessarily lazy constraints either. However, CPLEX
can support optimality-based cuts as lazy constraints.  
If you add an optimality-based cut as a lazy constraint in your model, you can also add it to
the user cut pool.  This practice of adding an optimality-based cut as a lazy 
constraint and simultaneously adding it to the user cut pool makes sure 
that CPLEX checks the optimality-based cut at each node relaxation as well as 
when CPLEX finds an integer feasible solution.</p>
<p class="p">Another way of comparing these two types of pools is to
note that the user designates constraints as lazy in the strong hope
and expectation that they will not need to be applied, thus saving
computation time by their absence from the working problem. In practice,
it is relatively costly (for a variety of reasons) to apply a lazy
constraint after a violation is identified, and so the user should
err on the side of caution when deciding whether a constraint should
be marked as lazy. In contrast, user cuts may be more liberally added
to a model because CPLEX is not obligated to use any of them and can
apply its own rules to govern their efficient use.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX offers an <strong class="ph b">example</strong> that highlights the difference between 
pools of user cuts and lazy constraints. The example demonstrates 
lazy constraint callbacks to separate integer feasible LP solutions and 
user cut callbacks to separate fractional infeasible LP solutions in a 
Benders decomposition of an asymmetric travelling salesperson problem.</p>
