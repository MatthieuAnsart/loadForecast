<h1 class="title topictitle1">Introduction to presolve</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes presolve with an example contrasting continuous
and discrete optimization.</p>
<p class="p">This discussion of the advanced presolve interface begins
with a quick introduction to presolve. Most of the information in
this section will be familiar to people who are interested in the
advanced interface, but everyone is encouraged to read through it
nonetheless.</p>
<p class="p">As most users of IBM ILOG CPLEX know, presolve is a process whereby
the problem input by the user is examined for logical reduction opportunities.
The goal is to reduce the size of the problem passed to the requested
optimizer. A reduction in problem size typically translates to a reduction
in total run time (even including the time spent in presolve itself).</p>
<p class="p">Consider <samp class="ph codeph">scorpion.mps</samp> from <strong class="ph b">NETLIB</strong> as an example: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>CPLEX&gt; disp pr st
Problem name: scorpion.mps
Constraints        :     388  [Less: 48,  Greater: 60,  Equal: 280]
Variables          :     358
Constraint nonzeros:    1426
Objective  nonzeros:     282
RHS        nonzeros:      76
CPLEX&gt; optimize
Tried aggregator 1 time.
LP Presolve eliminated 138 rows and 82 columns.
Aggregator did 193 substitutions.
Reduced LP has 57 rows, 83 columns, and 327 nonzeros.
Presolve time =    0.00 sec.

Dual - Optimal:  Objective =    1.8781248227e+03
Solution time =    0.01 sec.  Iterations = 54 (0)</code></pre>
<p class="p">CPLEX is presented with a problem with 388 constraints
and 358 variables, and after presolve the dual simplex method is presented
with a problem with 57 constraints and 83 variables. Dual simplex
solves this problem and passes the solution back to the presolve routine,
which then unpresolves the solution to produce a solution to the original
problem. During this process, presolve builds an entirely new ‘presolved’
problem and stores enough information to translate a solution to this
problem back to a solution to the original problem. This information
is hidden within the user's problem (in the CPLEX LP problem object,
for Callable Library users) and was inaccessible to the user in CPLEX
releases prior to 7.0.</p>
<p class="p">The presolve process for a mixed integer program is similar,
but has a few important differences. First, the actual presolve reductions
differ. Integrality restrictions allow CPLEX to perform several classes
of reductions that are invalid for continuous variables. A second
difference is that the MIP solution process involves a series of linear
program solutions. In the MIP branch &amp; cut tree, a linear program
is solved at each node. MIP presolve is performed at the beginning
of the optimization and applied a second time to the root relaxation,
unless the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/RelaxPreInd.html" title="Decides whether LP presolve is applied to the root relaxation in a mixed integer program (MIP).">relaxed LP presolve switch</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">RelaxPreInd</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_RELAXPREIND</samp>) is set to 0 (zero), in which case the presolve is performed only
once. All of the node relaxation solutions use the presolved model.
Again, presolve stores the presolved model and the information required
to convert a presolved solution to a solution for the original problem
within the LP problem object. Again, this information was inaccessible
to the user in CPLEX releases prior to version 7.0.</p>
