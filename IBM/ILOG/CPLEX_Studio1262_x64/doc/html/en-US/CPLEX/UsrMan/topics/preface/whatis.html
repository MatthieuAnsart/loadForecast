<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes CPLEX Component Libraries.</p>
<p class="p">IBM ILOG CPLEX
offers C, C++, Java, .NET, and Python libraries that solve linear
programming (LP) and related problems. Specifically, it solves linearly
or quadratically constrained optimization problems where the objective
to be optimized can be expressed as a linear function or a convex
quadratic function. The variables in the model may be declared as
continuous or further constrained to take only integer values. </p>
<p class="p">CPLEX comes in these forms to meet a wide range of users'
needs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The CPLEX Interactive Optimizer is an
executable program that can read a problem interactively or from files
in certain standard formats, solve the problem, and deliver the solution
interactively or into text files. The program consists of the file <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.exe</samp> on
Windows platforms or <samp class="ph codeph">cplex</samp> on UNIX platforms.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Concert Technology is a set of libraries
offering an API that includes modeling facilities to allow a programmer
to embed CPLEX optimizers in C++, Java, or .NET applications. The
library is provided in these files: 
<span class="ph filepath">ilocplexXXX.lib</span>, 
<samp class="ph codeph">concert.lib</samp>, 
and <span class="ph filepath">cplexXXX.jar</span>,
where <samp class="ph codeph">XXX</samp> represents a version number.
This convention of specifying the version number in the name 
of the library makes it possible for you to maintain
more than one version, if necessary.
The library is also provided in these files on Microsoft Windows platforms: 
<span class="ph filepath">cplexXXX.dll</span> and 
<span class="ph filepath">concertXXX.dll</span>
The library is also provided in these files on UNIX platforms: 
<samp class="ph codeph">libilocplex.a</samp>, 
<samp class="ph codeph">libconcert.a</samp>, 
and <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.jar</samp>.
In all those cases, Concert Technology makes  
use of the Callable Library (described next).</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The CPLEX Callable Library is a C library
that allows the programmer to embed CPLEX optimizers in applications
written in C, Visual Basic, Fortran or any other language that can
call C functions. The library is provided as a DLL on Windows platforms
and in a library (that is, with file extensions <samp class="ph codeph">.a</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">.so</samp> ,
or <samp class="ph codeph">.sl</samp> ) on UNIX platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In this manual, the phrase CPLEX Component Libraries
is used to refer equally to any of these libraries. While all libraries
are callable, the term Callable Library as used here refers specifically
to the C library.</p>
