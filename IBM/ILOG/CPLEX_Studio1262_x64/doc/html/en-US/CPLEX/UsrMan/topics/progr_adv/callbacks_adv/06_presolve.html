<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes presolve considerations for MIP control callbacks.</p>
<p class="p">This section addresses an important issue related to
presolve that the user of MIP control callbacks should be aware of. </p>
<p class="p">Most of the decisions made within MIP relate to the variables
of the problem. The heuristic, for example, finds values for all the
variables in the problem that produce a feasible solution. Similarly,
branching chooses a variable on which to branch. When considering
user callbacks, the difficulty that arises is that the user is familiar
with the variables in the original problem, while the branch &amp;
cut process is performed on the presolved problem. Many of the variables
in the original problem may have been modified or removed by presolve.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX provides two options for handling the problem of
mapping from the original problem to the presolved problem. First,
in an application of the Callable Library (C API),
the user may work directly with the presolved problem and presolved
solution vectors. This is the default. While this option may at first
appear unwieldy, note that the Advanced Presolve Interface allows
the user to map between original variables and presolved variables.
The downside to this option is that the user has to invoke
these advanced presolve routines manually. </p>
<p class="p">The second option (available only in applications of the Callable Library (C API), 
not in Concert Technology) is to set the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/MIPCBREDLP.html" title="Controls whether your callback accesses node information of the original model (off) or node information of the reduced, presolved model (on, default).">MIP callback switch between original model and reduced, presolved model</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_MIPCBREDLP</samp>)
to <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_OFF</samp>  (0), thus requesting that the
callback routines work exclusively with original variables. CPLEX
automatically translates the data between original and presolved data.</p>
<p class="p">While the second option is simpler, the first provides more control.
These two options will be revisited at several points in this chapter.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Remember</strong>: Callbacks in applications of Concert Technology 
(that is, the C++, Java, or .NET APIs) 
operate only on the original model, not the presolved model. That is, 
only the first option, manually invoking advanced presolve 
methods, is available and offers more control.</p>
