<h1 class="title topictitle1">Selecting an encoding</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains special considerations about encoding, also known
as code pages.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX offers parameters that specify the encoding (also known as
the code page) for CPLEX to use in the representation of data, whether
as input or output. For details about these encoding parameters, see
also the documentation of the  <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/APIEncoding.html" title="API string encoding switch">API string encoding switch</a>  and
the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/FileEncoding.html" title="file encoding switch">file encoding switch</a>  in
the <em class="ph i">CPLEX Parameters Reference Manual</em>.</p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> <p class="p">These encoding parameters have no effect on IBM CPLEX Optimizer
for z/OS, where only EBCDIC IBM-1047 encoding is available.</p>

<div class="p">However, the user must append the option 
<samp class="ph codeph">swaplfnl</samp> to the encoding name, like this:
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"IBM1047,swaplfnl"</code></pre>

in order to avoid anomalies due to a difference in the way that the 
IBM Java Virtual Machine and Runtime Environment interprets newline characters, 
and the way International Components for Unicode (ICU) interprets 
newline characters.</div>
</div>
<p class="p paragrouptitle"><strong class="ph b">Default encoding</strong></p>
<p class="p">By default, CPLEX uses the encoding ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin-1).
The familiar encoding known as ASCII is a subset of ISO-8859-1. In
fact, ISO-8859-1 supports a wide variety of character sets, so this
default is a reasonable choice for many users.</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle"><strong class="ph b">Multi-byte encoding</strong></p>
<p class="p">However, the encoding ISO-8859-1 cannot represent multi-byte character
sets, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, or Vietnamese characters,
for example.  If you want to represent a character set that requires
multiple bytes per character, then a better choice than the default
is the encoding UTF-8.  UTF-8 is a multi-byte character encoding that
can represent every character in the Unicode character set; that is,
it is sufficiently comprehensive for many purposes. It is compatible
with ASCII. It does not require byte-order marks (also known as BOM)
nor specification of big-end or little-end byte-order. It does not
include multi-byte characters that contain a <samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> byte
in their multi-byte encoding. In short, it is a serviceable if bulky
encoding for many users whose needs reach beyond ASCII or Latin-1.</p>
<p class="p">If you choose another multi-byte encoding,  such as UTF-32 or UTF-16,
for example, rather than UTF-8, be sure to specify the encoding fully
by including the byte order, like this:  UTF-32LE or UTF-32BE.</p>
<p class="p">Also take care if you choose another multi-byte encoding, such
as UTF-16 or UTF-32, instead of UTF-8: CPLEX routines such as <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/msg.html" title="The routine CPXXmsg/CPXmsg writes a message to a specified channel.">CPXmsg</a></samp> do
not work well with those encodings because those encodings include
characters that contain a <samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> byte in their multi-byte
representation. The presence of these <samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> bytes
can lead to unfortunate coincidences in representation and thus unintended
renderings of characters.</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle"> <strong class="ph b">Example: hazardous encodings</strong></p>
<p class="p">To get an idea of the hazards of such encodings, imagine a situation
in which a user creates a model as a file in a favorite editor with
the encoding <samp class="ph codeph">cp424</samp>, an extension of ASCII to support
Hebrew characters. The unsuspecting user names the model gimel (a
single Hebrew character, not reproduced here). In this model, the
user names each variable with a distinct, single Hebrew character.
The user, aware that the encoding used in the editor is not the default
file encoding in CPLEX, carefully sets the CPLEX file encoding parameter
to the value <samp class="ph codeph">cp424</samp> before reading the file into CPLEX.
Unfortunately, our unlucky user then relies on the default value ISO-8859-1
of the API encoding  parameter of CPLEX to write the problem to disk.
Since the Hebrew character gimel (the name of the model) cannot be
represented in the Latin-1 code page, a silent substitution of the
ISO08859-1 substitute character (hex value 0x1a) occurs. Equally calamitous,
all the variables in the model appear to have the same name, {0x1a,
0x00}, because some representations in the encoding <samp class="ph codeph">cp424</samp> unfortunately
coincide with other character representations in the default API encoding
ISO-8859-1,  though this coincidence does not appear to the software
to be an error.</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle"><strong class="ph b">Advice</strong></p>
<p class="p">To avoid hazardous situations such as that example, the documentation
of relevant features of CPLEX call your attention to the current value
of the parameters  <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/APIEncoding.html" title="API string encoding switch">API string encoding switch</a>  and <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/FileEncoding.html" title="file encoding switch">file encoding switch</a>.
 The documentation also urges caution about your choice of an encoding
that allows a <samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> byte in the representation of
characters. The documentation also notes that your choice of encoding
must be a superset of ASCII. The documentation of the encoding parameters
also point out that when you change either of them from its default
setting, you must verify that your change is consistent with the value
of the other encoding parameter.</p>
