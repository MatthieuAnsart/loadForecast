<h1 class="title topictitle1">Heuristic callback</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the heuristic callback.</p>
<p class="p">This topic introduces the heuristic callback. The first step in
using this callback is to call <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/setheuristiccallbackfunc.html" title="The routine CPXXsetheuristiccallbackfunc/CPXsetheuristiccallbackfunc sets or modifies the user-written callback to be called by CPLEX during MIP optimization after the subproblem has been solved to optimality.">CPXsetheuristiccallbackfunc</a></samp>,
with a pointer to a callback function and optionally a pointer to
user private data as arguments. Among the examples distributed with
the product, there is an advanced example <span class="ph filepath">admipex2.c</span> 
showing details of how this callback is used. After this routine has
been called, CPLEX calls the user callback function at every <strong class="ph b">viable</strong> node
in the branch &amp; cut tree. (A node is viable if its LP relaxation
is feasible and its relaxation objective value is better than that
of the best available integer solution.) CPLEX calls the user callback
routine with the solution vector for the current relaxation as input.
The callback function should return a feasible solution vector, if
one is found, as output.</p>
<p class="p">The advanced MIP control interface provides several routines that
allow the user callback to gather information that may be useful in
finding heuristic solutions. The routines <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbackgloballb.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbackgloballb/CPXgetcallbackgloballb retrieves the best known global lower bound values during MIP optimization from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbackgloballb</a></samp> and <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbackglobalub.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbackglobalub/CPXgetcallbackglobalub retrieves the best known global upper bound values during MIP optimization from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbackglobalub</a></samp>,
for example, return the tightest known global lower and upper bounds
on all the variables in the problem. No feasible solution whose objective
is better than that of the best known solution can violate these bounds.
Similarly, the routines <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbacknodelb.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbacknodelb/CPXgetcallbacknodelb retrieves the lower bound values for the subproblem at the current node during MIP optimization from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbacknodelb</a></samp> and <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbacknodeub.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbacknodeub/CPXgetcallbacknodeub retrieves the upper bound values for the subproblem at the current node during MIP optimization from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbacknodeub</a></samp> return
variable bounds at this node. These reflect the bound adjustments
made during branching. The routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbackincumbent.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbackincumbent/CPXgetcallbackincumbent retrieves the incumbent values during MIP optimization from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbackincumbent</a></samp> returns
the current incumbent - the best known feasible solution. The routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbacklp.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbacklp/CPXgetcallbacklp retrieves the pointer to the MIP problem that is in use when the user-written callback function is called.">CPXgetcallbacklp</a></samp> returns
a pointer to the MIP problem (presolved or unpresolved, depending
on the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/MIPCBREDLP.html" title="Controls whether your callback accesses node information of the original model (off) or node information of the reduced, presolved model (on, default).">MIP callback switch between original model and reduced, presolved model</a>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_MIPCBREDLP</samp>).
This pointer can be used to obtain various information about the problem
(variable types, etc.), or as an argument for the advanced presolve
interface if the user wants to translate manually between presolved
and unpresolved values. In addition, the callback can use the <samp class="ph codeph">cbdata</samp> 
parameter passed to it, along with routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbacknodelp.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbacknodelp/CPXgetcallbacknodelp returns a pointer to the subproblem at the current node from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbacknodelp</a></samp>,
to obtain a pointer to the node relaxation LP. This can be used to
access  information about the relaxation (row count, column count,
etc.). Note that in both cases, the user should never use the pointers
obtained from these callbacks to modify the associated problems.</p>
<p class="p">As noted earlier, the <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_MIPCBREDLP</samp> parameter
influences the arguments to the user callback routine. If this parameter
is set to its default value of <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_ON</samp>  (1), the solution
vector returned to the callback, and any feasible solutions returned
by the callback, are presolved vectors. They contain one value for
each variable in the presolved problem. The same is true of the various
callback support routines (<samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbackgloballb.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbackgloballb/CPXgetcallbackgloballb retrieves the best known global lower bound values during MIP optimization from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbackgloballb</a></samp>,
etc.). If the parameter is set to <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_OFF</samp>  (0), all
these vectors relate to variables of the original problem. Note that
this parameter should not be changed in the middle of an optimization.</p>
<p class="p">The user should be aware that the branch &amp; cut process works
with the presolved problem, so the code will incur some cost when
translating from presolved to original values. This cost is usually
small, but can sometimes be significant. </p>
<p class="p">We should also note that if a user wants to solve linear programs
as part of a heuristic callback, the user must make a copy of the
node LP (for example, using <samp class="ph codeph">CPXcloneprob</samp> ). The user
should not modify the CPLEX node LP.</p>
