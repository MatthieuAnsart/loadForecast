<h1 class="title topictitle1">Modifying a problem</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes conditions in which to modify a model after presolve.</p>
<p class="p">This section briefly discusses the mechanics of modifying a model
after presolve has been performed. This discussion applies only to
linear programs; it does <strong class="ph b">not</strong> apply to quadratic programs, quadratically
constrained programs, nor mixed integer programs.</p>
<p class="p">As noted earlier, the user must specify through the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</samp>,
documented in <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/Reduce.html" title="Specifies whether primal reductions, dual reductions, both, or neither are performed during preprocessing.">primal and dual reduction type</a>, the types
of modifications that are going to be performed on the model. Recall
that if primal reductions are turned off, the user can add variables,
change the righthand-side vector, or loosen variable bounds without
losing the presolved model. These changes are made through the standard
problem modification interface (<samp class="ph codeph">CPXaddcols</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPXchgrhs</samp>,
and <samp class="ph codeph">CPXchgbds</samp>). </p>
<p class="p">If dual reductions are turned off, the user can add constraints
to the problem, change the objective function, or tighten variable
bounds. Variable bounds are tightened through the standard interface
(<samp class="ph codeph">CPXchgbds</samp>). The addition of constraints or changes
to the objective value must be done through the two routines <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/preaddrows.html" title="The routine CPXXpreaddrows/CPXpreaddrows adds rows to an LP problem object and its associated presolved LP problem object.">CPXpreaddrows</a></samp> and <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/prechgobj.html" title="The routine CPXXprechgobj/CPXprechgobj changes the objective function coefficients of an LP problem object and its associated presolved LP problem object.">CPXprechgobj</a></samp>.
The constraints added by <samp class="ph codeph">CPXpreaddrows</samp> are equivalent
to but sometimes different from those input by the user. The dual
variables associated with the added rows may take different values
than those the user might expect.</p>
<p class="p">If a user makes a problem modification that is not consistent with
the setting of <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</samp>, CPLEX discards the
presolved model, and presolve is re-invoked at the next optimization
call. Similarly, CPLEX discards the presolved model if the user modifies
a variable or constraint that presolve had previously removed from
the problem. You can use <samp class="ph codeph">CPXpreaddrows</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">CPXprechgobj</samp> to
make sure that this will not happen. Note that <samp class="ph codeph">CPXpreaddrows</samp> also
permits changes to the bounds of the presolved model. If the nature
of the procedure dictates a real need to modify the variables that
presolve removed, you can use the <samp class="ph codeph">CPXcopyprotected</samp> routine
to instruct CPLEX not to remove those variables from the problem.</p>
<p class="p">Instead of changing the bounds on the presolved model, consider
changing the bounds on the original model. CPLEX will discard the
presolved model, but calling <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/presolve.html" title="The routine CPXXpresolve/CPXpresolve performs LP or MIP presolve depending whether a problem object is an LP or a MIP.">CPXpresolve</a></samp> will
cause CPLEX to apply presolve to the modified model, with the added
benefit of reductions based on the latest modifications. Then use <samp class="ph codeph">CPXcrushx</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPXcrushpi</samp>,
and <samp class="ph codeph">CPXcopystart</samp> to provide an advanced start for
the problem after presolve has been applied on the modified problem.</p>
