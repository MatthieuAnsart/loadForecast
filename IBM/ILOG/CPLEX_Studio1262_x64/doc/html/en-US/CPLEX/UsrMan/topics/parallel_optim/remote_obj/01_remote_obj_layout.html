<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the layout of a distributed application using the remote object.</p>
<p class="p">An application that uses the CPLEX remote object to implement a
distributed parallel algorithm consists of these components:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">A master process</strong>: This master process controls multiple worker processes. 
    Because the master process conventionally runs on a local machine, it is also 
    sometimes referred to as <em class="ph i">the local application</em> or <em class="ph i">the local process</em>.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">One or more worker processes</strong>: These processes often run on a remote machine, 
    so they are also referred to as <em class="ph i">remote applications</em> or as 
    <em class="ph i">remote processes</em>, in contrast to the master. </li>
<li class="li">Optionally <strong class="ph b">a dynamically loaded library</strong>; that is, user-written code that is 
    loaded into the worker processes and executed there.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">All three of these components are conventionally compiled into different executable files.</p>
<p class="p">The master process is code written entirely by the application developer. It dynamically 
links to CPLEX libraries in order to include the code that is required to connect to the 
worker processes. The master often runs on a local machine. In a simple application design, 
the master process is simply a process that frequently hands out work as jobs to the worker processes.</p>
<p class="p">A worker process runs on a remote machine. (In fact, workers can run in separate 
    processes on the local machine as well; more about that idea in other topics.) 
    One instance of a worker process represents one instance of a remote Callable Library object. 
    A worker process starts when the <samp class="ph codeph">cplex</samp> binary file is invoked with the argument 
<samp class="ph codeph">-worker=process</samp>,  
<samp class="ph codeph">-worker=mpi</samp>, or 
<samp class="ph codeph">-worker=tcpip</samp> 
depending on which data transport type is needed. The topic 
<a class="xref" href="02_ref_man_transport_types.html" title="Documents the transport protocols supporting the remote object.">Transport types for the remote object</a> 
explains data transport types and their options. </p>
<p class="p">By default, a worker process does not run any user-written code. However, 
it is possible to augment or extend a worker process by dynamically loading user-defined, user-written  
code into this worker process. To augment or extend a worker process, a <strong class="ph b">user function</strong> instructs 
the worker process to load a dynamically loaded object and to execute a 
predefined function in this object. The idea of a user function is explained in 
the topic <a class="xref" href="06_user_function.html" title="Documents user functions for the remote object.">User functions to run user-defined code on the remote machine</a>.</p>
