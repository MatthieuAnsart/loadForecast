<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes conditions favoring the sifting optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">Sifting was developed to exploit the characteristics
of models with large aspect ratios (that is, a large ratio of the
number of columns to the number of rows). In particular, the method
is well suited to large aspect ratio models where an optimal solution
can be expected to place most variables at their lower bounds. The
sifting algorithm can be thought of as an extension to the familiar
simplex method. It starts by solving a subproblem (known as the working
problem) consisting of all rows but only a small subset of the full
set of columns, by assuming an arbitrary value (such as its lower
bound) for the solution value of each of the remaining columns. This
solution is then used to re-evaluate the reduced costs of the remaining
columns. Any columns whose reduced costs violate the optimality criterion
become candidates to be added to the working problem for the next
major sifting iteration. When no candidates are present, the solution
of the working problem is optimal for the full problem, and sifting
terminates.</p>
<p class="p">The choice of optimizer to solve the working problem
is governed by the <samp class="ph codeph">SiftAlg</samp> parameter. You
can set this parameter to any of the values accepted by the <samp class="ph codeph">LPMethod</samp> parameter,
except for <samp class="ph codeph">Concurrent</samp> and of course <samp class="ph codeph">Sifting</samp> itself.
At the default <samp class="ph codeph">SiftAlg</samp> setting, CPLEX chooses
the optimizer automatically, typically switching between barrier and
primal simplex as the optimization proceeds. It is recommended that
you not turn off the barrier crossover step (that is, do not set the
parameter <samp class="ph codeph">BarCrossAlg</samp> to -1) when you use
the sifting optimizer, so that this switching can be carried out as
needed.</p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> <p class="p">If you invoke concurrent optimization on a 
linear program (LP), the concurrent optimzer checks the aspect ratio 
of the model. If the concurrent optimizer finds a large aspect ratio, 
and if ten or more threads are available to CPLEX, then the 
concurrent optimizer also invokes sifting on the LP model.
