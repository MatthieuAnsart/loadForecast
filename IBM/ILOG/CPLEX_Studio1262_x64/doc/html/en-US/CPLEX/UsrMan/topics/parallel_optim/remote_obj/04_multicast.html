<h1 class="title topictitle1">Multicast: invoking the same methods on a group of objects</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Introduces the idea of multicasting for the remote object.</p>
<p class="p">In certain situations, you need to call the same function on all remote objects, or possibly
on a group of remote objects. Of course, one option is to loop over all the remote objects 
in the group, 
invoking the function for each object individually. However, if great amounts of data 
(such as a large matrix) must be transferred as the arguments of the function, then 
calling the function repeatedly in a loop quickly introduces too much overhead.  Some transport 
protocols offer improved data handling 
in situations where one knows that the same data must be sent to multiple machines. 
In that context, the following paragraphs explain how to send data to multiple 
remote objects at the same time, a practice known as <strong class="ph b">multicasting</strong>.</p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> <p class="p">Multicasting is available in all transport protocols supported by CPLEX. The performance 
improvement of multicasting (as compared with a loop over all remote targets) is more obvious 
in some transport protocols, such as message passing interfaces (MPI), than in others. </p>

<p class="p">Multicasting is available in the Callable Library (C API). It is not available in 
the C++ API, nor in the Java API.</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Creating an environment group</strong></p>
<p class="p">Since each remote object is represented by a pointer to a CPLEX environment 
<span class="keyword apiname">CPXENVptr</span>, there is a reliable correspondance between each remote 
objects and its CPLEX environment (<samp class="ph codeph">env</samp>). Consequently, invoking a function
on multiple remote objects has the same effect as invoking that function on a group
of environments. In order to call the same function on a group of environments,
you first need to create such a group. To do so, use the function 
<span class="keyword apiname">CPXXcreateenvgroup</span>.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>int CPXXcreateenvgroup (CPXENVGROUPptr *group_p, int nenvs,
                        CPXENVptr const *envs)</code></pre>
<p class="p">This function creates a group from the number of environments 
<samp class="ph codeph">nenvs</samp> specified in <samp class="ph codeph">envs</samp>. 
It stores a pointer to the newly created group in <samp class="ph codeph">group_p</samp>.
Each environment can appear only once in the group. That is, 
it is an error to include duplicates in the array of environments.
After the group is created, you can invoke other functions on the group,
rather than on individual environments.</p>
<p class="p">The reference manual documents the following functions, which are 
available for operations on a group of environments.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">void CPXXfreeenvgroup (CPXENVGROUPptr *group_p)</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">int CPXXgetenvgroupsize (CPXCENVGROUPptr group)</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">CPXENVptr CPXXgetenvgroupenv (CPXCENVGROUPptr group, int idx)</samp></li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Which routines are available for multicasts?</strong></p>
<p class="p">For every CPLEX Callable Library routine that accepts an environment <samp class="ph codeph">env</samp> 
and a pointer to a linear programming problem <samp class="ph codeph">lp</samp>, (such as
<samp class="ph codeph">CPXXfoo(env, lp, ...)</samp>),  there is <samp class="ph codeph">CPXXfoo_multicast(group, ...)</samp> 
available for use with the remote object.  Likewise, for every
CPLEX Callable Library routine that accepts only an environment <samp class="ph codeph">env</samp>  
(such as, for example, <samp class="ph codeph">CPXbar(env, ...)</samp>), there is a corresponding multicast 
routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXbar_multicast(group, ...)</samp>. In both cases, (whether the routine 
accepts only an environment, or whether the routine accepts 
both an environment and a linear programming problem) the rest of the argument list of the multicast 
routine replicates the argument list of the original routine.</p>
<p class="p">In short, not all CPLEX Callable Library routines have a corresponding 
multicast function.  To support a multicast implementation, a CPLEX 
routine must satisfy these criteria:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">No output arguments except a status return value</li>
<li class="li">At most, one problem object as an input argument</li>
<li class="li">An environment as an input argument</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Example: calling a function on a group of environments</strong></p>
<p class="p">After you have created a group of environments, it is easy to call 
the same function on each environment in the group simultaneously. As an 
example, suppose you want to enable screen output for all the environments 
in a group. In other words, you want to turn on the screen indicator 
parameter (<span class="keyword apiname">CPX_PARAM_SCRIND</span>). Of course, it would be 
inefficient and time-consuming to loop over the environments like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   /* inefficient implementation */
   for (i = 0; i &lt; NUMENVS; ++i) {
      status = CPXXsetintparam (envs[i], CPX_PARAM_SCRIND, CPX_ON);
      /* Check status here. */
      ...
   }</code></pre>
<p class="p">Instead, you can invoke a multicast function on the group of environments, like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   CPXENVGROUPptr group;
   int status;

   status = CPXXcreateenvgroup (&amp;group, NUMENVS, envs);
   /* Check status here */
   ...
   status = CPXXsetintparam_multicast (group, CPX_PARAM_SCRIND, CPX_ON);
   /* Check status here */
   ...</code></pre>
<p class="p">In other words, instead of calling <span class="keyword apiname">CPXXsetintparam</span> 
with a single CPLEX environment pointer <span class="keyword apiname">CPXENVptr</span> as 
argument, you call <span class="keyword apiname">CPXXsetintparam_multicast</span> 
with an environment group as argument. The status returned by 
<span class="keyword apiname">CPXXsetintparam_multicast</span> is 0 (zero) only if the
invocation of the function succeeds on <strong class="ph b">all</strong> remote objects in the group.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Problem object and multicasting</strong></p>
<p class="p">Consider for a moment a typical modification of a model, such as 
deleting rows from the problem object, and recall the signature of 
the CPLEX routine for such a task.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>int CPXXdelrows (CPXCENVptr env, CPXLPptr lp, CPXDIM begin, CPXDIM end)</code></pre>
<p class="p">That routine deletes the rows with indices specified by the 
arguments <samp class="ph codeph">[begin, end]</samp> from the problem object 
referenced by <samp class="ph codeph">lp</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">The signature of the multicast version of that routine looks like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>int CPXdelrows_multicast (CPXENVGROUPptr group, CPXDIM begin, CPXDIM end)</code></pre>
<p class="p">Notice that there is no problem object in the signature of the 
multicast function. In fact, the problem object reference would be 
different for different remote objects and a meaningful multicast 
would no longer be possible. To allow multicasts with functions 
that have a problem object argument (either a pointer to a 
CPLEX linear program <span class="keyword apiname">CPXLPptr</span> or to a 
CPLEX network program <span class="keyword apiname">CPXNETptr</span>) the problem object 
argument is <em class="ph i">implied</em> for multicast functions. In other words, 
each remote object holds at most one problem object.  When it 
performs a multicast, CPLEX assumes that this
unique problem object is the argument for the function (if a problem
object is required at all). </p>
<p class="p">This convention implies that when you 
invoke a multicast function on an environment group, every environment
in the group has a problem object of the appropriate type. In other words,
it is an error to invoke a multicast function on an environment group 
in which not every environment has a problem object of the required type.</p>
