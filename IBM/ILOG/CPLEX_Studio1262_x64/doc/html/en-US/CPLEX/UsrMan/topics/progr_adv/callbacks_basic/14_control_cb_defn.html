<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Defines control callbacks.</p>
<p class="p">Control callbacks allow you to control the branch &amp; cut
search during the optimization of MIP problems. Because control callbacks
intervene in the search, the presence of a control callback in an
application will cause CPLEX to turn off dynamic search. In other words, 
dynamic search is turned off and cannot be enabled in the presence of 
control callbacks.</p>
<p class="p">By default, parallel MIP solving is also turned off. That is, if 
control callbacks are enabled, and if the 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/Threads.html" title="Sets the default number of parallel threads that will be invoked by any CPLEX parallel optimizer.">global thread count</a> 
(<samp class="ph codeph">Threads</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_THREADS</samp>)
parameter is at its default value of 0 (zero), 
then CPLEX uses only a single thread and executes sequentially; that is, 
CPLEX does not execute in parallel mode by default under those conditions. 
The reason for this default behavior is that CPLEX 
cannot guarantee the order of control callback invocation in the presence of 
user-written control callbacks that intervene in the search.  That is, their 
invocation is nondeterministic, even in deterministic parallel mode. Consequently, 
by default, CPLEX protects a user from this nondeterministic behavior by 
turning off parallel optimization and solving sequentially in the presence of 
control callbacks.</p>
<p class="p">However, you can enable 
parallel solving even in the presence of control callbacks by setting the 
threads parameter to a nonzero positive value. There are distinct situations 
in which you might want to enable parallel solving even in the presence of 
control callbacks: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">You are using only locally available CPLEX data for the decisions in your  
control callbacks.</li>
<li class="li">You are using opportunistic parallel mode. (That is, you do not require 
deterministic behavior.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The topic <a class="xref" href="16_control_cb_dyn_srch.html" title="Describes control callbacks as incompatible with dynamic search.">Control callbacks and dynamic search</a> 
offers more information about this point.</p>
<p class="p">If you want to take advantage of dynamic search in your application, 
and you see a need for a callback to report progress, 
consider an informational callback instead of a control callback. 
The topic <a class="xref" href="03_info_cb_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents informational callbacks.">Informational callbacks</a> explains
more about this alternative, which is compatible with dynamic search.</p>
