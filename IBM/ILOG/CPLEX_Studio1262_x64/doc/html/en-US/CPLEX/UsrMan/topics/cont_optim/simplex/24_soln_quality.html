<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Documents facilities for evaluating solution quality in
LP models.</p>
<p class="p">Infeasibility and unboundedness in linear programs are closely
related.  (For more about that idea, see the topics in  <a class="xref" href="../../infeas_unbd/partInfeasUnbnded_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents tools to help you analyze the source of the infeasibility in a model: the preprocessing reduction parameter for distinguishing infeasibility from unboundedness, the conflict refiner for detecting minimal sets of mutually contradictory bounds and constraints, and FeasOpt for repairing infeasibilities.">Infeasibility and unboundedness</a>.)
 When the linear program CPLEX solves is <em class="ph i">infeasible</em>, the associated
dual linear program has an <em class="ph i">unbounded</em> ray. Similarly, when the
dual linear program is <em class="ph i">infeasible</em>, the primal linear program
has an <em class="ph i">unbounded</em> ray. This relationship is important for proper
interpretation of infeasible solution output.</p>
<p class="p">The treatment of models that are unbounded involves a few subtleties.
Specifically, a declaration of unboundedness means that CPLEX has
detected that the model has an unbounded ray. Given any feasible solution
x with objective z, a multiple of the unbounded ray can be added to
x to give a feasible solution with objective z-1 (or z+1 for maximization
models). Thus, if a feasible solution exists, then the optimal objective
is unbounded. Note that CPLEX has not necessarily concluded that a
feasible solution exists. To see whether CPLEX has also concluded
that the model has a feasible solution, use one of these routines
or methods:</p>

</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">By default, individual infeasibilities are written to a log file
but not displayed on the screen. To display the infeasibilities on
your screen, in Concert Technology, use methods of the environment
to direct the output stream to a log file; in the Interactive Optimizer,
use the command <samp class="ph codeph">set output logonly y cplex.log</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">For C++ applications, see <a class="xref" href="../../APIs/Cpp/soln_info.html" title="Describes available information about solution feasibility, solution variables, basis information, and solution quality.">Accessing solution information</a>, and for Java applications,
see <a class="xref" href="../../APIs/Java/12_access_soln.html" title="Describes the information available in the Java API about a solution.">Accessing solution information</a>.
Those sections highlight the application programming details of how
to retrieve statistics about the quality of a solution.</p>
<p class="p">Regardless of whether a solution is infeasible or optimal, the
command <samp class="ph codeph">display solution quality</samp> in the Interactive
Optimizer displays the bound and reduced-cost infeasibilities for
both the scaled and unscaled problem. In fact, it displays the following
summary statistics for both the scaled and unscaled problem:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">maximum bound infeasibility, that is, the largest bound violation;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">maximum reduced-cost infeasibility;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">maximum row residual;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">maximum dual residual;</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">maximum absolute value of a variable, a slack variable, a dual
variable, and a reduced cost.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When the simplex optimizer detects infeasibility in the primal
or dual linear program (LP), parts of the solution it provides are
relative to the Phase I linear program it solved to conclude infeasibility.
In other words, the result you see in such a case is not the solution
values computed relative to the original objective or original righthand
side vector. Keep this distinction in mind when you interpret solution
quality; otherwise, you may be surprised by the results. In particular,
when CPLEX detects that a linear program is infeasible using the primal
simplex method, the reduced costs and dual variables provided in the
solution are relative to the objective of the Phase I linear program
it solved. Similarly, when CPLEX detects that a linear program is
unbounded because the dual simplex method detected dual infeasibility,
the primal and slack variables provided in the solution are relative
to the Phase I linear program created for the dual simplex optimizer. </p>
<p class="p">The following sections discuss these summary statistics in greater
detail. </p>

infeasibility: identifying largest bound violation</h2><p class="p">The
maximum bound infeasibility identifies the largest bound violation.
This information may help you discover the cause of infeasibility
in your problem. If the largest bound violation exceeds the feasibility
tolerance of your problem by only a small amount, then you may be
able to get a feasible solution to the problem by increasing the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/EpRHS.html" title="Specifies the feasibility tolerance, that is, the degree to which the basic variables of a model may violate their bounds.">feasibility tolerance</a> parameter
(<samp class="ph codeph">EpRHS</samp> in Concert Technology, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_EPRHS</samp> in
the Callable Library). Its range is between <samp class="ph codeph">1e-9</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">0.1</samp>.
Its default value is <samp class="ph codeph">1e-6</samp>. </p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.640018__User_manual.uss_solveLP.639306"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Maximum reduced-cost
infeasibility</h2><p class="p">The
maximum reduced-cost infeasibility identifies a value for the optimality
tolerance that would cause CPLEX to perform additional iterations.
It refers to the infeasibility in the dual slack associated with reduced
costs. Whether CPLEX terminated with an optimal or infeasible solution,
if the maximum reduced-cost infeasibility is only slightly smaller
in absolute value than the optimality tolerance, then solving the
problem with a smaller optimality tolerance may result in an improvement
in the objective function.</p>
<p class="p">To change the optimality tolerance,
set the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/EpOpt.html" title="Influences the reduced-cost tolerance for optimality.">optimality tolerance</a> parameter
(<samp class="ph codeph">EpOpt</samp> in Concert Technology, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_EPOPT</samp> in
the Callable Library).  Its range is between <samp class="ph codeph">1e-9</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">0.1</samp>.
Its default value is <samp class="ph codeph">1e-6</samp>.</p>

<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.640018__User_manual.uss_solveLP.639297"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Maximum row residual</h2>          <p class="p">The
maximum row residual identifies the maximum constraint violation.
CPLEX simplex optimizers control these residuals only indirectly by
applying numerically sound methods to solve the given linear system.
When CPLEX terminates with an infeasible solution, all infeasibilities
will appear as bound violations on structural or slack variables,
not constraint violations. That is, the row residuals compare the
 righthand side of the constraint with the lefthand side (including
slacks)  for the computed solution.   The maximum row residual may
help you decide whether a model of your problem is poorly scaled,
or whether the final basis (whether it is optimal or infeasible) is
ill-conditioned.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.640018__User_manual.uss_solveLP.668299"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Maximum dual residual</h2><p class="p">The maximum dual residual
indicates the numeric accuracy of the reduced costs in the current
solution. By construction, in exact arithmetic, the dual residual
of a basic solution is always 0 (zero). A nonzero value is thus the
effect of roundoff error due to finite-precision arithmetic in the
computation of the dual solution vector. Thus, a significant nonzero
value indicates ill conditioning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.640018__User_manual.uss_solveLP.639301"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Maximum absolute
values: detecting ill-conditioned problems</h2><p class="p">When you are trying to decide whether your problem
is ill-conditioned, you also need to consider the following maximum
absolute values, all available in the infeasibility analysis that
CPLEX provides you:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">variables;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">slack variables;</p>

<li class="li"><p class="p">dual variables;</p>

<p class="p">When using the Component Libraries, use the method  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html#getQuality" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">getQuality</a> or the routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/getdblquality.html" title="The routine CPXXgetdblquality/CPXgetdblquality accesses double-valued information about the quality of the current solution of a problem.">CPXgetdblquality</a></samp> to
access the information provided by the command <samp class="ph codeph">display solution quality</samp> in
the Interactive Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">If you discover
from this analysis that your model is indeed ill-conditioned, then
you need to reformulate it. <a class="xref" href="23_ill_conditioned_or_unscaled_infeas.html" title="Describes the effect of scaling on infeasible LP models.">Coping with an ill-conditioned problem or handling unscaled infeasibilities</a> outlines
