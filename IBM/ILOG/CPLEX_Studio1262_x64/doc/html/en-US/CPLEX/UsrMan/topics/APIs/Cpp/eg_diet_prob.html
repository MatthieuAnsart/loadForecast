<h1 class="title topictitle1">Problem representation</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes how the problem is represented in the application.</p>
<p class="p">The problem contains a set of foods, which are the modeling
variables; a set of nutritional requirements to be satisfied, which
are the constraints; and an objective of minimizing the total cost
of the food. There are two ways of looking at this problem:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The problem can be modeled by rows,
by entering the variables first and then adding the constraints on
the variables and the objective function.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The problem can be modeled by columns,
by constructing a series of empty constraints and then inserting the
variables into the constraints and the objective function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Concert Technology is equally suited for both kinds of
modeling; in fact, you can even mix both approaches in the same program.
If a new food product is created, you can create a new variable for
it regardless of how the model was originally built. Similarly, if
a new nutrient is discovered, you can add a new constraint for it.</p>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_cplusIloCplex.123979__User_manual.uss_cplusIloCplex.123818"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Creating a model row by row</h2><p class="p">You walk into the store and compile a list of foods that
are offered. For each food, you store the price per unit and the amount
in stock. For some foods that you particularly like, you also set
a minimum amount you would like to use in your diet. Then, for each
of the foods, you create a modeling variable to represent the quantity
to be purchased for your diet. </p>
<p class="p">Now you get a nutrition book and look up which nutrients
are known and relevant for you. For each nutrient, you note the minimum
and maximum amounts that should be found in your diet. Also, you go
through the list of foods and decide how much a food item will contribute
for each nutrient. This gives you one constraint per nutrient, which
can naturally be represented as a range constraint in pseudo-code
like this: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>nutrMin[i] &lt;= sum_j (nutrPer[i][j] * Buy[j]) &lt;= nutrMax[i]</code></pre>
<p class="p">where <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>  represents the number
of the nutrient under consideration, <samp class="ph codeph">nutrMin[i]</samp> 
and <samp class="ph codeph">nutrMax[i]</samp>  the minimum and maximum
amount of nutrient <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>  and <samp class="ph codeph">nutrPer[i][j]</samp> 
the amount of nutrient <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>  in food <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp> . </p>
<p class="p">Finally, you specify your objective function in pseudo-code
like this: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>minimize sum_j (cost[j] * Buy[j])</code></pre>
<p class="p">The loop in the example combines those two ideas and
looks like this:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   mod.add(IloMinimize(env, IloScalProd(Buy,foodCost)));
   for (i = 0; i &lt; m; i++) {
      IloExpr expr(env);
      for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {
         expr += Buy[j] * nutrPer[i][j];
      }
      mod.add(nutrMin[i] &lt;= expr &lt;= nutrMax[i]);
      expr.end();</code></pre>
<p class="p">This way of creating the model appears in the function <samp class="ph codeph">buildModelByRow</samp> ,
in the example <samp class="ph codeph">ilodiet.cpp</samp> .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_cplusIloCplex.123979__User_manual.uss_cplusIloCplex.116496"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Creating a model column by column</h2><p class="p">You start with the nutrition book where you compile the
list of nutrients that you want to make sure are properly represented
in your diet. For each of the nutrients, you create an empty constraint:
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>nutrMin[i] ≤ ... ≤ nutrMax[i]
</code></pre>
<p class="p">where <samp class="ph codeph">...</samp>  is left to be filled
in after  you walk into the store. Also, you set up the objective
function to minimize the cost. Constraint <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> 
is referred to as <samp class="ph codeph">range[i]</samp>  and to the
objective as <samp class="ph codeph">cost</samp> . </p>
<p class="p">Now you walk into the store and, for each food, you check
the price and nutritional content. With this data you create a variable
representing the amount you want to buy of the food type and install
the variable in the objective function and constraints. That is, you
create the following column in pseudo code, like this:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cost(foodCost[j]) "+" "sum_i" (range[i](nutrPer[i][j]))</code></pre>
<p class="p">where the notation <samp class="ph codeph">+</samp>  and <samp class="ph codeph">sum</samp> 
indicate in pseudo code that you add the new variable <samp class="ph codeph">j</samp> 
to the objective <samp class="ph codeph">cost</samp>  and constraints
range[<samp class="ph codeph">i</samp> ]. The value in parentheses is
the linear coefficient that is used for the new variable. This notation
is similar to the syntax actually used in Concert Technology, as demonstrated
in the function <samp class="ph codeph">buildModelByColumn</samp> , in
the example <samp class="ph codeph">ilodiet.cpp</samp> .  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {
      IloNumColumn col = cost(foodCost[j]);
      for (i = 0; i &lt; m; i++) {
         col += range[i](nutrPer[i][j]);
      }
      Buy.add(IloNumVar(col, foodMin[j], foodMax[j], type));
      col.end();
   }</code></pre>
