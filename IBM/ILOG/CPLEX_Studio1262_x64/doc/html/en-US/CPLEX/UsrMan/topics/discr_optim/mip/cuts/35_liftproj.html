<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Defines lift-and-project cuts.</p>
<p class="p">Lift and project cuts are split cuts  separated by fixing 
the (split) disjunction in advance.</p>
<p class="p">A MIP problem can be divided into two subproblems by 
branching on an integer variable or on any combination of 
integer variables of the MIP. Those two subproblems suggest 
two disjoint LP relaxations. A <em class="ph i">lift-and-project cut</em>  
is a linear inequality satisfied by the two LP relaxations 
defined by branching on a given integer variable 
or combination of integer variables. (That 
inequality, however, need not be valid for the 
LP relaxation of the original problem.)</p>
<p class="p">More formally, a valid split disjunction for a MIP problem looks like this:  </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../../images/LiftAndProject_disj.jpg" alt="((the coefficient d) times (the variable x)) less than or equal to (d sub naught) or (d times x) greater than or equal to (d sub naught plus one)" /> </p>
<p class="p">where <em class="ph i">d</em> is a vector of coprime integer values, <em class="ph i">d<sub class="ph sub">0</sub></em> 
is an integer, and <em class="ph i">d<sub class="ph sub">j</sub></em> is equal to 0 (zero) for all 
continuous variables <em class="ph i">x</em>. In other words, the disjunction is defined 
only on the integer-constrained variables of the MIP.</p>
<p class="p">Given the polyhedron <em class="ph i">P</em> corresponding to the LP relaxation of the MIP, 
and given a valid split disjunction for that MIP, 
all the MIP feasible solutions are contained in one of the two disjoint 
polyhedra defined by <em class="ph i">P</em> intersecting the split disjunction. That is,
the MIP feasible solutions are here:</p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../../images/LiftAndProject_P0.jpg" alt="P naught is equal to the set of all x such that x is in P and d times x is less than or equal to d naught" /> 
<strong class="ph b">OR</strong> 
<img class="image" src="../../../../images/LiftAndProject_P1.jpg" alt="P one is equal to the set of all x such that x is in P and d times x is greater than or equal to d naught plus one" /> </p>
<p class="p">A lift-and-project cut is an inequality 
that is valid for the union of <em class="ph i">P<sub class="ph sub">0</sub></em>
and <em class="ph i">P<sub class="ph sub">1</sub></em>, though not valid for <em class="ph i">P</em>.</p>
<p class="p">Lift and project cuts as implemented in CPLEX can also be helpful 
in solving mixed integer quadratically constrained programs (MIQCP) 
under certain conditions.</p>
