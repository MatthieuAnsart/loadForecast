<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes implementation of goals in the search in the
C++ API.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">The discussion of the details of using goals will be
presented mainly in terms of the C++ API. The Java and .NET APIs follow
the same design and are thus equivalent at this level of discussion.
In cases where a difference between these APIs needs to be observed,
the point will be raised. Where the difference is only in syntax,
the other syntax will be mentioned in parentheses following the C++
syntax. </p>
</div>
<p class="p">In C++, goals are implemented in objects of type <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI</samp> (having
the handle class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::Goal</samp>). In Java,
goals are implemented in objects of type <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.Goal</samp> (and
there are no handle classes). In .NET, goals are implemented by the
class <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.Goal</samp>. The method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI::execute</samp> (<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.Goal.execute</samp>)
is where the control is implemented. This method is called by <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> after
a node relaxation has been solved and all cuts have been added. Invoking
the method <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp>  of a goal is often
referred to as <em class="ph i">executing a goal</em>.
When the method <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp> is executed, other
methods of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI</samp>  (<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.Goal</samp> 
or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.Goal</samp> ) can be called to query
information about the current node problem and the solution of its
relaxation.</p>
