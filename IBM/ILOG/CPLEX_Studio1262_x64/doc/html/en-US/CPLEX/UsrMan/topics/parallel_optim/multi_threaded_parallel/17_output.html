<p class="p">The sample reports that the processors spent an average
of 0.00 of a second of real time waiting for other processors to provide
nodes to be processed. The Sync time is the average time a processor
spends trying to synchronize by accessing globally shared data. Because
only one processor at a time can access such data, the amount of time
spent in synchronization is really crucial: any other processor that
tries to access this region must wait, thus sitting idle, and this
idle time is counted separately from the Wait time.</p>
<p class="p">There is another difference in the way logging occurs
in the parallel MIP optimizer. When this optimizer is called, it makes
a number of copies of the problem. These copies are known as clones.
The parallel MIP optimizer creates as many clones as there are threads
available to it. When the optimizer exits, these clones and the memory
they used are discarded.</p>
<p class="p">If a log file is active when the clones are created,
then CPLEX creates a <strong class="ph b">clone log file</strong> for
each clone. The clone log files are named <samp class="ph codeph">cloneK.log</samp>,
where <samp class="ph codeph">K</samp> is the index of the clone, ranging
from 0 (zero) to the number of threads minus one. Since the clones
are created at each call to the parallel MIP optimizer and discarded
when it exits, the clone logs are opened at each call and closed at
each exit. (The clone log files are not removed when the clones themselves
are discarded.)</p>
<p class="p">The clone logs contain information normally recorded
in the ordinary log file (by default, <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.log</samp>)
but inconvenient to send through the normal log channel. The information
likely to be of most interest to you are special messages, such as
error messages, that result from calls to the LP optimizers called
for the subproblems.</p>
