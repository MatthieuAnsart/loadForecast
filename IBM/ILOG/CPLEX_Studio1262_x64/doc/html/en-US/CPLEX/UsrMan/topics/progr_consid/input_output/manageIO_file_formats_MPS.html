<h1 class="title topictitle1">Working with MPS files</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes programming considerations for working with
MPS file format.</p>
<p class="p">The CPLEX MPS file reader is highly compatible with files
created by other modeling systems that respect the MPS format. There
is generally no need to modify existing problem files to use them
with CPLEX. However, there are CPLEX-specific conventions that may
be useful for you to know. This section explains those conventions,
and the <em class="ph i">CPLEX File Formats Reference
Manual</em> documents the MPS format more fully.</p>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002243__User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002258"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Free rows in MPS files</h2><p class="p">In an MPS file, CPLEX selects the first free row or N-type
row as the objective function, and it discards all subsequent free
rows unless it is instructed otherwise by an <samp class="ph codeph">OBJNAME</samp> section
in the file. To retain free rows in an MPS file, reformulate them
as equality rows with an additional free variable. For example, replace
the free row <samp class="ph codeph">x + y</samp> by the equality
row <samp class="ph codeph">x + y - s = 0</samp> where <samp class="ph codeph">s</samp> is
free. Generally, the CPLEX presolver will remove rows like that before
optimization so they will have no impact on performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002243__User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002268"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ranged rows in MPS files</h2><p class="p">To handle ranged rows, CPLEX introduces a temporary range
variable, creates appropriate bounds for this variable, and changes
the sense of the row to an equality (that is, MPS type EQ). The added
range variables will have the same name as the ranged row with the
characters <samp class="ph codeph">Rg</samp> prefixed. When CPLEX generates
solution reports, it removes these temporary range variables from
the constraint matrix.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002243__User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002278"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Extra rim vectors in MPS files</h2><p class="p">The MPS format allows multiple righthand sides (RHSs),
multiple bounds, and multiple range vectors. It also allows extra
free rows. Together, these features are known as extra rim vectors.
By default, the CPLEX MPS reader selects the first RHS, bound, and
range definitions that it finds. The first free row (that is, N-type
row) becomes the objective function, and the remaining free rows are
discarded. The extra rim data are also discarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002243__User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002289"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Naming conventions in MPS files</h2><p class="p">CPLEX accepts any noncontrol-character within a name.
However, CPLEX recognizes blanks (that is, spaces) as delimiters,
so you must avoid them in names. You should also avoid <samp class="ph codeph">$</samp> (dollar
sign) and <samp class="ph codeph">*</samp> (asterisk) as characters in
names because they normally indicate a comment within a data record.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002243__User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002297"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Error checking in MPS files</h2><p class="p">Fairly common problems in MPS files include split vectors,
unnamed columns, and duplicated names. CPLEX checks for these conditions
and reports them. If repeated rows or columns occur in an MPS file,
CPLEX reports an error and stops reading the file. You can then edit
the MPS file to correct the source of the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002243__User_manual.uss_manageIO.1002306"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Saving modified MPS files</h2><p class="p">You may often want to save a modified MPS file for later
use. To that end, CPLEX writes out a problem exactly as it appears
in memory. All your revisions of that problem will appear in the new
file. One potential area for confusion occurs when a maximization
problem is saved. Since MPS conventionally represents all problems
as minimizations, CPLEX reverses the sign of the objective-function
coefficients when it writes a maximization problem to an MPS file.
When you read and optimize this new problem, the values of the variables
will be valid for the original model. However, since the problem has
been converted from a maximization to the equivalent minimization,
the objective, dual, and reduced-cost values will have reversed signs.</p>
