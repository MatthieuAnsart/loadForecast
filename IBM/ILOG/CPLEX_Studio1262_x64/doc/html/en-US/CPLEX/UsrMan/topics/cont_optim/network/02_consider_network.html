<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes conditions under which the network optimizer
is appropriate.</p>
<p class="p">As explained in <a class="xref" href="../../APIs/C/05_appli_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes an application of the C API.">Using the Callable Library in an application</a>,
to exploit IBM ILOG
CPLEX in your own application, you must first create a CPLEX environment,
instantiate a problem object, and populate the problem object with
data. As your next step, you call a CPLEX optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">If part of your problem is structured as a network, then
you may want to consider calling the CPLEX network optimizer. This
optimizer may have a positive impact on performance. There are two
alternative ways of calling the network optimizer: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">If your problem is an LP where a large
part is a network structure, you may call the network optimizer for
the populated LP object.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If your entire problem consists of a
network flow, you should consider creating a network object instead
of an LP object. Then populate it, and solve it with the network optimizer.
This alternative generally yields the best performance because it
does not incur the overhead of LP data structures. This option is
available only for the Callable library.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">How much performance improvement you observe between
using only a simplex optimizer versus using the network optimizer
followed by either of the simplex optimizers depends on the number
and nature of the other constraints in your problem. On a pure network
problem, performance has been measured as 10–100 times faster
with the network optimizer. However, if the network component of your
problem is small relative to its other parts, then using the solution
of the network part of the problem as a starting point for the remainder
may or may not improve performance, compared to running the primal
or dual simplex optimizer. Only experiments with your own problem
can tell.</p>
