<h1 class="title topictitle1">Branch selection callback</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes special considerations about the branch selection
callback.</p>
<p class="p">The next callback to consider is the branch variable selection
callback. </p>
<p class="p">After <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/setbranchcallbackfunc.html" title="The routine CPXXsetbranchcallbackfunc/CPXsetbranchcallbackfunc sets and modifies the user-written callback routine to be called after a branch has been selected but before the branch is carried out during MIP optimization.">CPXsetbranchcallbackfunc</a></samp> is
called with a pointer to a user callback routine, the user routine
is called whenever CPLEX makes a branching decision. CPLEX indicates
which variable has been chosen for branching and allows the user to
modify that decision. The user may specify the number of children
for the current node (between 0 and 2), and the set of bounds or constraints
that are modified for each child through one of the routines  <samp class="ph codeph">CPXbranchcallbackbranchbds</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">CPXbranchcallbackbranchconstraints</samp> ,
or <samp class="ph codeph">CPXbranchcallbackbranchgeneral</samp>. The children
are explored in the order that they are returned. The branch callback
routine is called for all viable nodes. In particular, it will be
called for nodes that have zero integer infeasibilities; in this case,
CPLEX will not have chosen a branch variable, and the default action
will be to discard the node. The user can choose to branch from this
node and in this way impose additional restrictions on integer solutions.</p>
<p class="p">For example, a user branch routine may call <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbacknodeintfeas.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbacknodeintfeas/CPXgetcallbacknodeintfeas retrieves information for each variable about whether or not the variable is integer feasible in the subproblem at the current node.">CPXgetcallbacknodeintfeas</a></samp> to
identify branching candidates, call <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbackpseudocosts.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbackpseudocosts/CPXgetcallbackpseudocosts retrieves the pseudo-cost values during MIP optimization from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbackpseudocosts</a></samp> to
obtain pseudo-cost information on these variables, call <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbackorder.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbackorder/CPXgetcallbackorder retrieves MIP priority order information during MIP optimization from within a user-written callback.">CPXgetcallbackorder</a></samp> to
get priority order information, make a decision based on this and
perhaps other information, and then respond that the current node
will have two children, where one has a new lower bound on the branch
variable and the other has a new upper bound on that variable.</p>
<p class="p">Alternatively, the branch callback routine can be used to sculpt
the search tree by pruning nodes or adjusting variable bounds. Choosing
zero children for a node prunes that node, while choosing one node
with a set of new variable bounds adjusts bounds on those variables
for the entire subtree rooted at this node. Note that the user must
be careful when using this routine for anything other than choosing
a different variable to branch on. Pruning a valid node or placing
an invalid bound on a variable can prune the optimal solution.</p>
<p class="p">We should point out one important detail associated with the use
of the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/MIPCBREDLP.html" title="Controls whether your callback accesses node information of the original model (off) or node information of the reduced, presolved model (on, default).">MIP callback switch between original model and reduced, presolved model</a>,<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_MIPCBREDLP</samp>,
in a branch callback. If this parameter is set to <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_OFF</samp> 
(0), the user can choose branch variables (and add bounds) for the
original problem. However, not every fractional variable is actually
available for branching. Recall that some variables are replaced by
linear combinations of other variables in the presolved problem. Since
branching involves adding new bounds to specific variables in the
presolved problem, a variable must be present in the presolved problem
for it to be branched on. The user should use the <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/getcallbacknodeintfeas.html" title="The routine CPXXgetcallbacknodeintfeas/CPXgetcallbacknodeintfeas retrieves information for each variable about whether or not the variable is integer feasible in the subproblem at the current node.">CPXgetcallbacknodeintfeas</a></samp> routine
from the Advanced Presolve Interface to find branching candidates
(those for which <samp class="ph codeph">CPXgetcallbacknodeintfeas</samp>  returns <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_INTEGER_INFEASIBLE</samp> ).
The <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/copyprotected.html" title="The routine CPXXcopyprotected/CPXcopyprotected specifies a set of variables that should not be substituted out of the problem.">CPXcopyprotected</a></samp> routine
can be used to prevent presolve from removing specific variables from
the presolved problem. (In Concert Technology, this issue is handled
for you automatically.) While restricting branching may appear to
limit your ability to solve a problem, in fact a problem can always
be solved to optimality by branching only on the variables of the
presolved problem.</p>
<p class="p">By design, the CPLEX branch callback calculates and provides the 
branching decisions 
that CPLEX would make in case the user does not create any branches in 
the callback. Depending on variable selection and other details 
of your model, the computation of these candidate branches can be 
time-consuming. Consequently, if you know that you will <strong class="ph b">never</strong> 
use the branching candidates suggested by CPLEX, then you can save time 
by disabling such features as strong branching.</p>
