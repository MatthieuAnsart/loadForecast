<h1 class="title topictitle1">Using the Interactive Optimizer for debugging</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes Interactive Optimizer more fully as debugger.</p>
<p class="p">The CPLEX Interactive Optimizer distributed with the Component
Libraries offers a way to see what is going on within the CPLEX part
of your application when you observe peculiar behavior in your optimization
application. The commands of the Interactive Optimizer correspond
exactly to routines of the Component Libraries, so anomalies due to
the CPLEX-part of your application will manifest themselves in the
Interactive Optimizer as well, and contrariwise, if the Interactive
Optimizer behaves appropriately on your problem, you can be reasonably
sure that routines you call in your application from the Component
Libraries work in the same appropriate way.</p>
<p class="p">With respect to parameter settings, you can write a parameter file
with the file extension .<samp class="ph codeph">prm</samp> from your application
by means of one of these methods:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::writeParam</samp> in the C++ API</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.writeParam</samp> in the Java API</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.WriteParam</samp> in the .NET API</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">CPXwriteparam</samp> in the Callable Library</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">write</samp> <em class="ph i">file</em> <samp class="ph codeph">.prm</samp> in
the Interactive Optimizer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The Interactive Optimizer can read a .<samp class="ph codeph">prm</samp> file
and then set parameters exactly as they are in your application. </p>
<p class="p">In the other direction, you can use the <samp class="ph codeph">display</samp> command
in the Interactive Optimizer to show the nondefault parameter settings;
you can then save those settings in a <samp class="ph codeph">.prm</samp> file for
re-use later. See the topic <a class="xref" href="../../../../InteractiveOptimizer/topics/saveParamSpecs.html" title="A parameter specification file records your customized parameter settings..">Saving a parameter specification file</a> in
the reference manual of the Interactive Optimizer for more detail
about using a parameter file in this way.</p>
<p class="p">To use the Interactive Optimizer for debugging, you first need
to write a version of the problem from the application into a formatted
file that can then be loaded into the Interactive Optimizer. To do
so, insert a call to the method <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html#exportModel" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">exportModel</a> or to the
routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/writeprob.html" title="The routine CPXXwriteprob/CPXwriteprob writes a CPLEX problem object to a file in one of the formats in the table.">CPXwriteprob</a></samp> into
your application. Use that call to create a file, whether an LP, SAV,
or MPS formatted problem file. (<a class="xref" href="../input_output/manageIO_file_formats_synopsis.html" title="Explains programming considerations about widely used file formats.">Understanding file formats</a> briefly
describes these file formats.) Then read that file into the Interactive
Optimizer and optimize the problem there.</p>
<p class="p">Note that MPS, LP and SAV files have differences that influence
how to interpret the results of the Interactive Optimizer for debugging.
SAV files contain the exact binary representation of the problem as
it appears in your program, while MPS and LP files are text files
containing possibly less precision for numeric data. And, unless every
variable appears on the objective function, CPLEX will probably order
the variables differently when it reads the problem from an LP file
than from an MPS or SAV file. With this in mind, SAV files are the
most useful for debugging using the Interactive Optimizer, followed
by MPS files, then finally LP files, in terms of the change in behavior
you might see by use of explicit files. On the other hand, LP files
are often quite helpful when you want to examine the problem, more
so than as input for the Interactive Optimizer. Furthermore, try solving
both the SAV and MPS files of the same problem using the Interactive
Optimizer. Different results may provide additional insight into the
source of the difficulty. In particular, use the following guidelines
with respect to reproducing your program’s behavior in the Interactive
Optimizer.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">If you can reproduce the behavior with a SAV file, but not
with an MPS file, this suggests corruption or errors in the problem
data arrays. Use the <samp class="ph codeph">DataCheck</samp> parameter or diagnostic
routines in the source file <samp class="ph codeph">check.c</samp> to track down
the problem.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If you can reproduce the behavior in neither the SAV file nor
the MPS file, the most likely cause of the problem is that your program
has some sort of memory error. Memory debugging tools such as Purify
will usually find such problems quickly.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">When solving a problem in MPS or LP format, if the Interactive
Optimizer issues a message about a segmentation fault or similar ungraceful
interruption and exits, contact CPLEX customer support to arrange
for transferring the problem file. The Interactive Optimizer should
never exit with a system interrupt when solving a problem from a text
file, even if the program that created the file has errors. Such cases
are extremely rare.</p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">If the peculiar behavior that you observed in your application
persists in the Interactive Optimizer, then you must examine the LP
or MPS or SAV problem file to discover whether the problem file actually
defines the problem you intended. If it does not define the problem
you intended to optimize, then the problem is being passed incorrectly
from your application to CPLEX, so you need to look at that part of
your application.</p>
<p class="p">Make sure the problem statistics and matrix coefficients indicated
by the Interactive Optimizer match the ones for the intended model
in your application. Use the Interactive Optimizer command <samp class="ph codeph">display problem stats</samp> to
verify that the size of the problem, the sense of the constraints,
and the types of variables match your expectations. For example, if
your model is supposed to contain only general integer variables,
but the Interactive Optimizer indicates the presence of binary variables,
check the type variable passed to the constructor of the variable
(Concert Technology) or check the specification of the <samp class="ph codeph">ctype</samp> array
and the routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/mipapi/copyctype.html" title="The routine CPXXcopyctype/CPXcopyctype can be used to copy variable type information into a given problem.">CPXcopyctype</a></samp> (Callable
Library). You can also examine the matrix, objective, and righthand
side coefficients in an LP or MPS file to see if they are consistent
with the values you expect in the model.</p>
