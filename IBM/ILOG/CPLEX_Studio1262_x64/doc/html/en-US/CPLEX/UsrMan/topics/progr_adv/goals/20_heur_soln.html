<h1 class="title topictitle1">Injecting heuristic solutions</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Defines heuristic solutions and describes the injection
of a heuristic solution by a goal.</p>
<p class="p">At any time in the execution of a goal, you may find
that, for example, by slightly manipulating the current node subproblem
solution, you may construct a solution to your model. Such solutions
are called <em class="ph i">heuristic solutions</em>,
and a procedure that generates them is called a <em class="ph i">heuristic</em>.</p>
<p class="p">Heuristic solutions can be injected into the branch &amp; cut
search by creating a solution goal with the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI::SolutionGoal</samp> (<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.solutionGoal</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.SolutionGoal</samp>).
Such a goal can be returned typically as a subgoal of an And goal
much like global cut goals.</p>
<p class="p">When CPLEX executes a solution goal, it does not immediately
use the specified solution as a potential new incumbent. The reason
is that with goals, part of the model may be specified via global
cuts or through specialized branching strategies. Thus the solution
needs first to be tested for feasibility with respect to the entire
model, including any part of the model specified through goals.</p>
<p class="p">To test whether an injected solution is feasible, CPLEX
first creates a subnode of the current node. This subnode will of
course inherit the goal stack from its parent. In addition, the solution
goal will push local cuts onto the stack of the subnode such that
all variables are fixed to the values of the injected solution.</p>
<p class="p">By processing this subnode as the next node, CPLEX makes
sure that either the solution is feasible with respect to all goals
or otherwise it is discarded. Goals that have been executed so far
are either reflected as global cuts or by the local cuts that are
active at the current node. Thus, if the relaxation remains feasible
after the variable fixings have been added, the feasibility of these
goals is certain.</p>
<p class="p">If at that point the goal stack is not empty, the goals
on the goal stack need to be checked for feasibility as well. Thus
by continuing to execute the goals from the goal stack, CPLEX will
either prove feasibility of the solution with respect to the remaining
goals or, in case the relaxation becomes infeasible, decide it really
is infeasible and discard the solution. The rest of the branch &amp; cut
search remains unaffected by all of this.</p>
<p class="p">The benefit of this approach is that your heuristic need
not be aware of the entire model including all its parts that might
be implemented via goals. Your heuristic can still safely be used,
as CPLEX will make sure of feasibility for the entire model. However,
there are some performance considerations to observe. If parts of
the model specified with goals are dominant, heuristic solutions you
generate might need to be rejected so frequently that you do not get
enough payoff for the work of running the heuristic. Also, your heuristic
should account for the global and local cuts that have been added
at the node where you run your heuristic so that a solution candidate
is not rejected right away and the work wasted.</p>
