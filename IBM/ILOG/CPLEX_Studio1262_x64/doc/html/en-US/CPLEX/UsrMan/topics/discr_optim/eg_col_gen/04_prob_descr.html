<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes a problem to illustrate column generation.</p>
<p class="p">The cutting stock problem in this chapter is sometimes
known in math programming terms as a knapsack problem with reduced
cost in the objective function.</p>
<p class="p">Generally, a cutting stock problem begins with a supply
of rolls of material of fixed length (the stock). Strips are cut from
these rolls. All the strips cut from one roll are known together as
a pattern. The point of this example is to use as few rolls of stock
as possible to satisfy some specified demand of strips. By convention,
it is assumed that only one pattern is laid out across the stock;
consequently, only one dimension—the width—of each roll
of stock is important. </p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="User_manual.uss_usingColumnGen.1001631__User_manual.uss_usingColumnGen.1003300"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Two different patterns from a roll of stock</span><div class="image"><img class="image" src="../../../images/usingColumnGenu.gif" alt="usingColumnGenu.gif" /></div></div>
<p class="p">Even with that simplifying assumption, the fact that
there can be so many different patterns makes a naive model of this
problem (where a user declares one variable for every possible pattern)
impractical. Such a model introduces too many symmetries. Fortunately,
for any given customer order, a limited number of patterns will suffice,
so many of the possible patterns can be disregarded, and the application
can focus on finding the relevant ones.</p>
<p class="p">Here is a conventional statement of a cutting stock problem
in terms of the unknown X<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>, the
number of times that pattern j will be used, and A<sub class="ph sub">ij</sub>, the number of items i of each pattern j needed
to satisfy demand d<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>: </p>
<p class="p">Minimize:   </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../images/usingColumnGen2.gif" alt="usingColumnGen2.gif" /> </p>
<p class="p">subject to: </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../images/usingColumnGen3.gif" alt="usingColumnGen3.gif" /></p>
<p class="p"> greater than or equal to d<sub class="ph sub">i</sub> with: </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../images/usingColumnGen4.gif" alt="usingColumnGen4.gif" /> </p>
<p class="p">Solving this model with all columns present from the
beginning is practically impossible. In fact, even with only 10 types
of items with a size roughly 1/10 of the width of the roll, there
would exist roughly 10^10 kinds of patterns, and hence that many decision
variables. Such a formulation might not even fit in memory on a reasonably
large computer. Moreover, most of those patterns would obviously not
be interesting in a solution. These considerations make column generation
an interesting approach for this problem.</p>
<p class="p">To solve a cutting stock problem by column generation,
start with a subproblem. Choose one pattern, lay it out on the stock,
and cut as many items as possible, subject to the constraints of demand
for that item and the width of the stock. This procedure will surely
work in that it produces some answer (a feasible solution) to the
problem, but it will not necessarily produce a satisfactory answer
in this way since it probably uses too many rolls. </p>
<p class="p">To move closer to a satisfactory solution, the application
can then generate other columns. That is, other decision variables
(other X<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>) will be chosen to
add to the model. Those decision variables are chosen on the basis
of their favorable reduced cost with the help of a subproblem. This
subproblem is defined to identify the coefficients of a new column
of the master problem with minimal reduced cost. With π as the
vector of the dual variables of the current solution of the master
problem, the subproblem is defined like this:</p>
<p class="p">Minimize: </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../images/usingColumnGen5.gif" alt="usingColumnGen5.gif" /> </p>
<p class="p">subject to: </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../images/usingColumnGen6.gif" alt="usingColumnGen6.gif" /> </p>
<p class="p">That is, the subproblem data consists of W as the width
of a roll of stock, W<sub class="ph sub">i</sub> as the
width of strip i that can be used in a pattern cut from the roll.
The entries A<sub class="ph sub">i</sub> are the modeling
variables of the subproblem. They specify the number of times the
i-th strip is used in the pattern. Their solution values will be the
coefficients of the new column to be added to the master model if
a solution with a negative objective function is found for the subproblem.
Consequently, the variables A<sub class="ph sub">i</sub> must be nonnegative integers.</p>
