<h1 class="title topictitle1">Running out of memory</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes remedies for limited memory.</p>
<p class="p">A very common difficulty with MIPs is running out of
memory. This problem almost always occurs when the branch &amp; cut
tree becomes so large that insufficient memory remains to solve a
continuous LP, QP, or QCP subproblem. (In the rare case that the dimensions
of a very large model are themselves the main contributor to memory
consumption, you can try adjusting the memory emphasis parameter,
as described in <a class="xref" href="../../../cont_optim/simplex/19_mem.html" title="Documents CPLEX behavior in limited memory for LP models.">Lack of memory</a>.)
As memory gets tight, you may observe warning messages from CPLEX
as it attempts various operations in spite of limited memory. In such
a situation, if CPLEX does not find a solution shortly, it terminates
the process with an error message.</p>
<p class="p">The information about a tree that CPLEX accumulates in
memory can be substantial. In particular, CPLEX saves a basis for
every unexplored node. Furthermore, when CPLEX uses the best bound
or best estimate strategies of node selection, the list of unexplored
nodes itself can become very long for large or difficult problems.
How large the unexplored node list can be depends on the actual amount
of memory available, the size of the problem, and algorithm selected.</p>
<p class="p">A less frequent cause of memory consumption is the generation
of cutting planes. Gomory fractional cuts, and, in rare instances,
Mixed Integer Rounding cuts, are the ones most likely to be dense
and thus use significant memory at default automatic settings. You
can try turning off these cuts, or any of the cuts you see listed
as being generated for your model (in the cuts summary at the end
of the node log), or simply all cuts, through the use of parameter
settings discussed in the section on cuts in this manual; doing this
carries the risk that this will make the model harder to solve and
only delay the eventual exhaustion of available memory during branching.
Since generation of cutting planes is not a frequent cause of memory
consumption, apply these recommendations only as a last resort, after
trying to resolve the problem with less drastic measures.</p>
<p class="p">Certainly, if you increase the amount of available memory,
you extend the problem-solving capability of CPLEX. Unfortunately,
when a problem fails because of insufficient memory, it is difficult
to project how much further the process needed to go and how much
more memory is needed to solve the problem. For these reasons, the
following suggestions aim at avoiding memory failure whenever possible
and recovering gracefully otherwise.</p>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.647315__User_manual.uss_solveMIP.647341"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reset the tree memory parameter</h2>




<p class="p">To avoid a failure due to running out of memory, set
the working memory parameter, <samp class="ph codeph">WorkMem</samp>,
to a value significantly lower than the available memory on your computer
(in megabytes), to instruct CPLEX to begin compressing the storage
of nodes before it consumes all of available memory. See the related topic 
<a class="xref" href="61_mem_gone.html#User_manual.uss_solveMIP.647315__User_manual.uss_solveMIP.647357">Use node files for storage</a>,
for other choices of what should happen when <samp class="ph codeph">WorkMem</samp> is
exceeded. That topic explains how to tell CPLEX that it should
use disk for working storage.</p>

<p class="p">Because the storage of nodes can require a lot of space,
it may also be advisable to set a tree limit on the size of the entire
tree being stored so that not all of your disk will be filled up with
working storage. The call to the MIP optimizer will be stopped after
the size of the tree exceeds the value of <samp class="ph codeph">TreLim</samp>,
the tree limit parameter. At default settings, the limit is infinity
(1e+75), but you can set it to a lower value (in megabytes).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.647315__User_manual.uss_solveMIP.647357"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Use node files for storage</h2>






















<p class="p">As noted in <a class="xref" href="../performance/24_node_files.html" title="Describes a storage feature for nodes of the search.">Using node files</a>,
CPLEX offers a node-file storage-feature to store some parts of the
branch &amp; cut tree in files as it progresses through
its search. This feature allows CPLEX to explore more nodes within
a smaller amount of computer memory. It also includes several options
to reduce the use of physical memory. Importantly, it entails only
a very small increase in runtime. In terms of performance, node-file
storage offers a much better option than relying on generic swap space
managed by your operating system.</p>

<p class="p">This feature is especially helpful when you are using
steepest-edge pricing as the subproblem simplex pricing strategy because
pricing information itself consumes a great deal of memory.  </p>

<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <p class="p">Try node files whenever the MIP optimizer terminates
with the condition "out of memory" and the node count is greater than
zero. The message in such a situation looks like the following sample
output. </p>
</div>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Clique cuts applied:  30 
CPLEX Error  1001: Out of memory.

Current MIP best bound =    5.5731783224e+04 (gap = 565.217, 1.00%)  </code></pre>

<p class="p">Several parameters control the use of
node files. They are:</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/WorkMem.html" title="Specifies an upper limit on the amount of central memory, in megabytes, that CPLEX is permitted to use for working memory.">memory available for working storage</a>: <samp class="ph codeph">WorkMem</samp> in
Concert Technology or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_WORKMEM</samp> in
the Callable Library</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/NodeFileInd.html" title="Used when working memory (CPX_PARAM_WORKMEM, WorkMem) has been exceeded by the size of the tree.">node storage file switch</a>: <samp class="ph codeph">NodeFileInd</samp> in
Concert Technology or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_NODEFILEIND</samp> in
the Callable Library</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/TreLim.html" title="Sets an absolute upper limit on the size (in megabytes, uncompressed) of the branch-and-cut tree.">tree memory limit</a>: <samp class="ph codeph">TreLim</samp> in
Concert Technology or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_TRELIM</samp> in
the Callable Library</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/WorkDir.html" title="Specifies the name of an existing directory into which CPLEX may store temporary working files.">directory for working files</a> <samp class="ph codeph">WorkDir</samp> in
Concert Technology or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_WORKDIR</samp> in
the Callable Library</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="p">CPLEX uses node file storage most effectively when the
amount of working memory is reasonably large so that it does not have
to create node files too frequently. The default value of the 
<samp class="ph codeph">WorkMem</samp> parameter
is 2048 megabytes (that is, 2 gigabytes). Setting it to higher values, even on a machine with
very large memory, can be expected to result in only marginally improved
efficiency. However, if your machine has less than 2 gigabytes of RAM, 
it is advisable to reduce this setting by at least 128 MB
to avoid defeating the purpose of node files,
a situation that would occur if your application inadvertently triggers
the swap space of your operating system.</p>
<p class="p">When tree storage size exceeds the limit defined by <samp class="ph codeph">WorkMem</samp>,
and if the tree-memory limit has not been exceeded, then what happens
next is decided by the setting of the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/NodeFileInd.html" title="Used when working memory (CPX_PARAM_WORKMEM, WorkMem) has been exceeded by the size of the tree.">node storage file switch</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">NodeFileInd</samp> in
Concert Technology or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_NODEFILEIND</samp> in
the Callable Library). If that parameter is set to zero, then optimization
proceeds with the tree stored in memory until CPLEX reaches the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/TreLim.html" title="Sets an absolute upper limit on the size (in megabytes, uncompressed) of the branch-and-cut tree.">tree memory limit</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">TreLim</samp> in
Concert Technology or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_TRELIM</samp> in
the Callable Library). If the node file indicator is set to <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> (the
default), then a fast compression algorithm is used on the nodes to
try to conserve memory, without resorting to writing the node files
to disk. If the parameter is set to 2, then node files are written
to disk. If the parameter is set to 3, then nodes are both compressed
(as in option 1) and written to disk (as in option 2). <a class="xref" href="61_mem_gone.html#User_manual.uss_solveMIP.647315__User_manual.uss_solveMIP.653681" title="A three-column table showing possible values, their effect, and comments.">Table 1</a> summarizes

<p class="p">Among the memory conservation tactics employed by CPLEX
when the memory emphasis parameter has been set, the maximum setting
for the node file indicator is automatically chosen, so that node-file
storage will go to disk. You may still wish to adjust the working
memory or tree limit parameters to fit the capabilities of your computer.</p>
<p class="p">In cases where node files are written to disk, CPLEX
will create a temporary subdirectory under the directory specified
by the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/WorkDir.html" title="Specifies the name of an existing directory into which CPLEX may store temporary working files.">directory for working files</a> parameter
(<samp class="ph codeph">WorkDir</samp> in Concert Technology or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_WORKDIR</samp> in
the Callable Library). The directory named by this parameter must
exist before CPLEX attempts to create node files. By default, the
value of this parameter is “.”, which means the current
working directory.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX creates the temporary directory by means of system
calls. If the system environment variable is set (on Windows platforms,
the environment variable <samp class="ph codeph">TMP</samp>; on UNIX platforms,
the environment variable <samp class="ph codeph">TMPDIR</samp>), then
the system ignores the CPLEX node-file directory parameter and creates
the temporary node-file directory in the location indicated by its
system environment variable. Furthermore, if the directory specified
in the CPLEX node-file directory parameter is invalid (for example,
if it contains illegal characters, or if the directory does not allow
write access), then the system chooses a location according to its
own logic.</p>
<p class="p">The temporary directory created for node file storage
will have a name prefixed by <samp class="ph codeph">cpx</samp>. The files
within it will also have names prefixed by <samp class="ph codeph">cpx</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX automatically removes the files and their temporary
directory when it frees the branch &amp; cut tree:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">in the Interactive Optimizer, </p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">at problem modification;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">at normal termination; </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">from Concert Technology,</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">when you call <samp class="ph codeph">env.end</samp> </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">when you modify the extracted model</p>

</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">when you call <samp class="ph codeph">CPXfreeprob</samp> .</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If a program terminates abnormally, the files are not
removed.</p>
<p class="p">Node files could grow very large. Use the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/TreLim.html" title="Sets an absolute upper limit on the size (in megabytes, uncompressed) of the branch-and-cut tree.">tree memory limit</a> parameter
(<samp class="ph codeph">TreLim</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_TRELIM</samp>)
to limit the size of the tree so that it does not exceed available
disk space, when you choose settings 2 or 3 in the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/NodeFileInd.html" title="Used when working memory (CPX_PARAM_WORKMEM, WorkMem) has been exceeded by the size of the tree.">node storage file switch</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">NodeFileInd</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_NODEFILEIND</samp>).
It is usually better to let CPLEX terminate the run gracefully, with
whatever current feasible solution has been found, than to trigger
an error message or even a program abort.</p>
<p class="p">When CPLEX uses node-file storage, the sequence of nodes
processed may differ from the sequence in which nodes are processed
without node-file storage. Nodes in node-file storage are not accessible
to user-written callback routines.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveMIP.647315__User_manual.uss_solveMIP.647482"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Change algorithms</h2><p class="p">The best approach to reduce memory use is to modify the
solution process. Here are some ways to do so:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Switch the node selection strategy to
best estimate, or more drastically to depth-first, as explained in <a class="xref" href="../performance/20_node_seln.html#User_manual.uss_solveMIP.684651__User_manual.uss_solveMIP.676690" title="A three-column table showing possible values of their parameter, their symbolic name, and their meaning.">Table 1</a>.
Depth-first search rarely generates a long, memory-consuming list
of unexplored nodes since CPLEX dives deeply into the tree instead
of jumping around. A narrowly focused search, like depth-first, also
often results in faster processing times for individual nodes. However,
overall solution time is generally much worse than with best-bound
node selection because each branch is searched exhaustively to its
deepest level before it is fathomed in favor of better branches.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Another memory-conserving strategy is
to use strong branching for variable selection; that is, set the <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/VarSel.html" title="Sets the rule for selecting the branching variable at the node which has been selected for branching.">MIP variable selection strategy</a> parameter
(<samp class="ph codeph">VarSel</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_VARSEL</samp>)
to the value <samp class="ph codeph">3</samp>. Strong branching requires
substantial computational effort at each node to decide the best branching
variable. As a result, it generates fewer nodes and thus makes less
overall demand on memory. Often, strong branching is faster as well.</p>
