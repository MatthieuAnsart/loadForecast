<h1 class="title topictitle1">Lack of memory</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Documents CPLEX behavior in limited memory for LP models.</p>
<p class="p">To sustain computational speed, CPLEX should use only
available physical memory, rather than virtual memory or paged memory.
Even if your problem data fit in memory, CPLEX will need still more
memory to optimize the problem. When CPLEX recognizes that only limited
memory is available, it automatically makes algorithmic adjustments
to compensate. These adjustments almost always reduce optimization
speed. If you detect when these automatic adjustments occur, then
you can decide when you need to add additional memory to your computer
to sustain computational speed for your particular problem. </p>
<p class="p">An alternative to obtaining more memory is to conserve
memory that is available. The memory emphasis parameter (<a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/MemoryEmphasis.html" title="Directs CPLEX that it should conserve memory where possible.">memory reduction switch</a>)
can help you in this respect. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">C++ Name MemoryEmphasis
(bool)</samp> in Concert Technology</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">C Name CPX_PARAM_MEMORYEMPHASIS
(int)</samp> in the Callable Library</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">emphasis memory</samp> in
the Interactive Optimizer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If you set the memory emphasis parameter to its optional
value of 1 (one), then CPLEX adopts memory conservation tactics at
the beginning of optimization rather than only after the shortage
becomes apparent. These tactics may still have a noticeable impact
on solution speed because these tactics change the emphasis from speed
to memory utilization, but they could give an improvement over the
default in the case where memory is insufficient. </p>
<p class="p">The following sections offer further guidance about memory
conservation if memory emphasis alone does not do enough for your
problem.</p>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.675271__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638508"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Warning messages</h2><p class="p">In certain cases, CPLEX issues a warning message when
it cannot perform an operation, but it continues to work on the problem.
Other CPLEX messages warn that CPLEX is compressing the problem to
conserve memory. These warnings mean that CPLEX finds insufficient
memory available, so it is following an alternate—less desirable—path
to a solution. If you provide more memory, CPLEX will return to the
best path toward a solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.675271__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638532"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Paging virtual memory</h2><p class="p">If you observe paging of memory to disk, then your application
is incurring a performance penalty. If you increase available memory
in such a case, performance will speed up dramatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.675271__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638533"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Refactoring frequency and memory requirements</h2><p class="p">The CPLEX primal and dual simplex optimizers refactor
the problem basis at a rate set by the <samp class="ph codeph">ReInv</samp> parameter.</p>
<p class="p">The longer CPLEX works between refactoring, the greater
the amount of memory it needs for each iteration. Consequently, one
way of conserving memory is to decrease the interval between refactoring.
In fact, if little memory is available to it, CPLEX will automatically
decrease the refactoring interval in order to use less memory at each
iteration.</p>
<p class="p">Since refactoring is an expensive operation, decreasing
the refactoring interval (that is, factoring more often) will generally
slow performance. You can tell whether performance is being degraded
in this way by checking the iteration log file.</p>
<p class="p">In an extreme case, lack of memory may force CPLEX to
refactor at every iteration, and the impact on performance will be
dramatic. If you provide more memory in such a situation, the benefit
will be tremendous.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.675271__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638559"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Preprocessing and memory requirements</h2><p class="p">By default, CPLEX automatically preprocesses your problem
before optimizing, and this preprocessing requires memory. If memory
is extremely tight, consider turning off preprocessing, by setting
the <samp class="ph codeph">PreInd</samp> parameter to 0 (zero). But doing
this foregoes the potential performance benefit of preprocessing,
and should be considered only as a last resort.</p>
