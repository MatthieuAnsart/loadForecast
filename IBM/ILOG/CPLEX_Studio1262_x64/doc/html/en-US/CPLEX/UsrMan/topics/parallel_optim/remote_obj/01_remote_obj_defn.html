<p class="p">IBM ILOG CPLEX
offers features that greatly simplify your development of applications implementing
parallel algorithms that use CPLEX on <strong class="ph b">distributed</strong> hardware. Though CPLEX itself does not
implement a distributed parallel algorithm as such, it does provide the CPLEX
<strong class="ph b">remote object</strong> to facilitate your own implementation.</p>
<p class="p">Consider the conventional layout of applications that use CPLEX locally, 
represented in this figure.</p>
<img class="image" src="../../../images/remoteObject_localAppliArch.jpg" /><p class="p">According to that layout, any application using CPLEX eventually invokes 
routines of the CPLEX Callable Library (C API). These routines are invoked 
either directly (by applications using the C API) or through dedicated 
application programming interfaces for applications using C++, Java, C#.NET, VB.NET, 
Python, or The MathWorks MATLAB. In other words, when your application uses only 
the CPLEX Callable Library, the entire application runs on a local machine.</p>
<p class="p">The introduction of the CPLEX remote object changes the situation slightly to a
layout that looks like the next figure.</p>
<img class="image" src="../../../images/remoteObject_distribArchi.jpg" /><p class="p">According to that figure, on your local machine, your application calls a
function in a remote CPLEX API, instead of calling the CPLEX Callable Library directly. 
This remote API implements stubs
that forward function calls to an instance of the CPLEX Callable Library that
is actually located on a remote machine. This instance of the 
Callable Library on the remote machine is also known as the 
<strong class="ph b">CPLEX remote object</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">As you can see in that figure, nothing fundamental changes for the 
user-written applications based on CPLEX. Such applications simply have to 
call the corresponding functions of the remote API (instead of calling the same 
familiar routines of the Callable Library locally). The remote API was carefully 
designed so that only minimal changes are required when a user 
switches from a strictly local application to a distributed application.</p>
