<h1 class="title topictitle1">Diagnosing QP infeasibility</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains infeasibility in the context of a quadratic
program.</p>
<p class="p">Diagnosis of an infeasible QP problem can be carried
out by the conflict refiner. See <a class="xref" href="../../infeas_unbd/conflict_refiner/01_ref_confl_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes the conflict refiner, a feature for diagnosing the cause of infeasibility in a model, whether continuous or discrete, whether linear or quadratic.">Diagnosing infeasibility by refining conflicts</a>.</p>
<p class="p">Note that it is possible for the outcome of that analysis
to be a confirmation that your model (viewed as an LP) is feasible
after all. This is typically a symptom that your QP model is numerically
unstable or ill-conditioned. Unlike the simplex optimizers for LP,
the QP optimizers are primal-dual in nature, and one result of that
is the scaling of the objective function interacts directly with the
scaling of the constraints. </p>
<p class="p">Just as our recommendation regarding numeric difficulties
on LP models (see <a class="xref" href="../simplex/20_num_difficulty.html" title="Documents CPLEX behavior with respect to numeric difficulties in LP models.">Numeric difficulties</a>)
is for coefficients in the constraint matrix not to vary by more than
about six orders of magnitude, for QP this recommendation expands
to include the quadratic elements of the objective function coefficients
as well. Fortunately, in most instances, it is straightforward to
scale your objective function, by multiplying or dividing all the
coefficients (linear and quadratic) by a constant factor, which changes
the unit of measurement for the objective but does not alter the meaning
of the variables or the sense of the problem as a whole. If your objective
function itself contains a wide variation of coefficient magnitudes,
you may also want to consider scaling the individual columns to achieve
a closer range.</p>
