<h1 class="title topictitle1">A proposed example</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes special considerations about presolve.</p>
<p class="p">Now consider an application where the user wants to
solve a linear program using the simplex method, then modify the problem
slightly and solve the modified problem. As an example, let's say
a user wants to add a few new constraints to a problem based on the
results of the first solution. The second solution should ideally
start from the basis of the first, since starting from an advanced
basis is usually significantly faster if the problem is only modified
slightly.</p>
<p class="p">Unfortunately, this scenario presents several difficulties.
First, presolve must translate the new constraints on the original
problem into constraints on the presolved model. Presolve in releases
prior to 7.0 could not do this. In addition, the new constraints may
invalidate earlier presolve reductions, thus rendering the presolved
model useless for the re-optimization. (There is an example in <a class="xref" href="04_reductions_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes conditions under which a user might restrict presolve.">Restricting presolve reductions</a>.) Presolve in releases prior to 7.0 had no way of disabling such
reductions. In the prior releases, a user could either restart the
optimization on the original, unpresolved model or perform a new presolve
on the modified problem. In the former case, the re-optimization does
not benefit from the reduction of the problem size by presolve. In
the latter, the second optimization does not have the benefit of an
advanced starting solution.</p>
<p class="p">The advanced presolve interface can potentially make
this and many other sequences of operations more efficient. It provides
facilities to restrict the set of presolve reductions performed so
that subsequent problem modifications can be accommodated. It also
provides routines to translate constraints on the original problem
to constraints on the presolved model, so new constraints can be added
to the presolved model. In short, it provides a variety of capabilities.</p>
<p class="p">When processing mixed integer programs, the advanced
presolve interface plays a very different role. The branch &amp; cut
process needs to be restarted from scratch when the problem is even
slightly modified, so preserving advanced start information isn't
useful. The main benefit of the advanced presolve interface for MIPs
is that it allows a user to translate decisions made during the branch
&amp; cut process (and based on the presolved model) back to the corresponding
constraints and variables in the original problem. This makes it easier
for a user to control the branch &amp; cut process. Details on the
advanced MIP callback interface are provided in <em class="ph i">Advanced MIP Control Interface</em>.</p>
