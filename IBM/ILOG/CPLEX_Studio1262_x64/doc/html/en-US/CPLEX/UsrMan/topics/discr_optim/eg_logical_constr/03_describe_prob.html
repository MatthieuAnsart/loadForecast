<h1 class="title topictitle1">Describing the problem</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the problem verbally.</p>
<p class="p">The problem is to plan the blending of five kinds of
oil, organized in two categories (two kinds of vegetable oils and
three kinds of non vegetable oils) into batches of blended products
over six months. </p>
<p class="p">Some of the oil is already available in storage. There
is an initial stock of oil of 500 tons of each raw type when planning
begins. An equal stock should exist in storage at the end of the plan.
Up to 1000 tons of each type of raw oil can be stored each month for
later use. The price for storage of raw oils is 5 monetary units per
ton. Refined oil cannot be stored. The blended product cannot be stored
either.</p>
<p class="p">The rest of the oil (that is, any not available in storage)
must be bought in quantities to meet the blending requirements. The
price of each kind of oil varies over the six-month period. </p>
<p class="p">The two categories of oil cannot be refined on the same
production line. There is a limit on how much oil of each category
(vegetable or non vegetable) can be refined in a given month:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Not more than 200 tons of vegetable
oil can be refined per month.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Not more than 250 tons of non vegetable
oil can be refined per month.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are constraints on the blending of oils:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The product cannot blend more than three
oils.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">When a given type of oil is blended
into the product, at least 20 tons of that type must be used.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If either vegetable oil 1 (v1) or vegetable
oil 2 (v2) is blended in the product, then non vegetable oil
3 (o3) must also be blended in that product.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The final product (refined and blended) sells for a known
price: 150 monetary units per ton.</p>
<p class="p">The aim of the six-month plan is to maximize profit by lowering 
production and storage costs.</p>
