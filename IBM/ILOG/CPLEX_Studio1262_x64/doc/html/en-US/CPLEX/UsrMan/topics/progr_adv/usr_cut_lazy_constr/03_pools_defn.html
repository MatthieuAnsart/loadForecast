<p class="p">Sometimes, for a MIP formulation, a user may already
know a large set of helpful cutting planes (<em class="ph i">user cuts</em>), or can identify a group
of constraints that are unlikely to be violated (<em class="ph i">lazy constraints</em>). Simply including
these cuts or constraints in the original formulation could make the
LP subproblem of a MIP optimization very large or too expensive to
solve. Instead, these situations can be handled in one of these ways:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">through one of the cut callbacks described
in <a class="xref" href="../callbacks_adv/01_adv_callbacks_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents the advanced MIP control interface.">Advanced MIP control interface</a>, or </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">by setting up <em class="ph i">cut pools</em> before MIP optimization
begins, as explained in <a class="xref" href="06_add_uc_lc_title_synopsis.html" title="You can add user cuts or lazy constraints through routines or methods in the Component Libraries or via LP, SAV, or MPS files, as explained in the following sections.">Adding user cuts and lazy constraints</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The principle in common between these two pools allows
the optimization algorithm to perform its computations on a smaller
model than it otherwise might, in the hope of delivering faster run
times. In either case (whether in the case of pools of user cuts or
pools of lazy constraints), the model starts out small, and then potentially
grows as members of the pools are added to the model. Both kinds of
pool may be used together in solving a MIP model, although that would
be an unusual circumstance.</p>
<p class="p">However, there are important distinctions between these
two concepts, as explained in
