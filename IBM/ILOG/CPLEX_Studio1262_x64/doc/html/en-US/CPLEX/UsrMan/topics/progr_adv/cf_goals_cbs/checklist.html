<h1 class="title topictitle1">Overview</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Outlines advantages of goals and callbacks.</p>
<p class="p">Goals and callbacks both provide an API within IBM ILOG CPLEX to allow you
to take control over the branch &amp; cut search for solving
MIP models. With one exception, the same functionality is available
in both goals and callbacks. In fact, the goal API is built on top
of callbacks. As a consequence, you can <strong class="ph b">not</strong> use callbacks and goals at the same time. To help you choose which
API is more suited to your needs, this topic examines commonalities
and differences between both.</p>
<div class="section" id="QVGwUykE__QvgPItUB"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">A quick checklist comparing goals and callbacks</h2><p class="p">Both approaches (goals and callbacks) allow you to control
the branch &amp; cut search used by CPLEX to solve MIP models.
The following points distinguish specific features of this control.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Checking feasibility</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">With goals, you can discontinue the
search at a node by returning a <samp class="ph codeph">Fail</samp> goal.
Alternatively, you can continue searching, even though an integer
feasible solution has been found, by returning another nonempty goal.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">With callbacks, you can use method <samp class="ph codeph">prune</samp> of the branch callback to discontinue the search,
and an incumbent callback to accept or reject integer feasible solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Creating branches</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">With goals, you create branches by using <samp class="ph codeph">Or</samp>  goals with local cut goals as parameters.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">With callbacks, you create branches
by using a branch callback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Adding local or global cuts</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">With goals, you can add global and local
cuts by using global and local cut goals, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">With callbacks, you need to implement
either a cut callback (for global and local cuts) or a branch callback
for branching on local cuts</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Injecting solution candidates</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">With goals, you inject solutions by
using a solution goal.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">With callbacks, you need to implement
a heuristic callback to inject solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Controlling the node selection strategy</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">With goals, you control node selection
by applying node evaluators to your search goal. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">With callbacks, you control node selection
by using a node callback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Supporting advanced starts</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Since goals can enforce constraints,
they do not support advanced starting information. An optimization
with goals starts from scratch.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Since each callback provides a specific
functionality, callbacks support advanced starts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="QVGwUykE__Ww5ro3D8"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Further notes about goals and callbacks</h2><p class="p">Thus, one of the main differences between goals and callbacks
is that with goals, all functionality is available from the <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp>  method of the goal, whereas with callbacks,
you must implement different callbacks to access different functionality.</p>
<p class="p">With goals, the feasibility test and the resulting branching
can be implemented with a single goal.</p>
<p class="p">The second big difference between goals and callbacks
is that with goals you can easily specify different search strategies
in different subtrees. To do this, simply provide different search
goals as a parameter to the <samp class="ph codeph">Or</samp>  goal when
creating the root nodes for the subtrees in question. To achieve a
similar result with callbacks requires an implementation that is too
complex for a presentation here.</p>
<p class="p">The only functionality that is not supported via goals
is that provided by the <samp class="ph codeph">solve</samp>  callback.
Because of this, the <samp class="ph codeph">solve</samp> callbacks can
be used at the same time as goals. However, this callback is very
rarely used.</p>
<p class="p">In summary, goals can be advantageous if you want to
take control over several steps of the branch &amp; cut
search simultaneously, or if you want to specify different search
strategies in different subtrees. On the other hand, if you only need
to control a single aspect of the search (for example, adding cuts)
using the appropriate callback may involve a smaller API and thus
be quicker and easier to understand and implement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="QVGwUykE__mI6BLI5A"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example contrasting goals and callbacks</h2><p class="p">As an example, suppose you want to extend a search to
satisfy additional constraints that could not conveniently be added
as linear constraints to the model. </p>
<p class="p">With callbacks, you need to use an incumbent callback
and a branch callback. The incumbent callback has to reject an otherwise
integer feasible solution if it violates such an additional constraint.
In this case, the branch callback has to follow up with an appropriate
branch to enforce the constraint. The choice of the appropriate branch
may be quite difficult for constraints not modeled with linear expressions,
even though CPLEX supports branching on hyperplanes. </p>
