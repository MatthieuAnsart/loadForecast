<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Documents the dispatch of data to remote objects in an example of distributed concurrent optimization of a mixed integer program.</p>
<p class="p">This example (<span class="ph filepath">parmipopt.c</span>) of distributed concurrent 
MIP optimization reads the data of the model from a file. One possibility for 
dispatching the data from that original file to the remote objects (in this 
example, the two workers) is to iterate over the remote objects and read the 
data file to each of them. In this example, the number of remote objects (two) 
is small, but in general the number of remote objects can be huge. If the 
number of remote objects is truly large, iterating over the individual remote 
objects and loading the data file into each of them can be impractical or 
unrealistic. In contrast, using a <strong class="ph b">multicast</strong> to load the data file 
simultaneously into all the remote objects is usually faster. In fact, 
some transport implementations provide special handling of multicasts 
that can improve performance dramatically. The message passing interface (MPI)
is one such transport.</p>
<p class="p">To take advantage of a multicast, the following lines of code first create 
an <strong class="ph b">environment group</strong>. That group contains all the environments of 
remote objects that participate in the multicast. </p>
<img class="image" src="../../../images/egRemoteObj_env_group.jpg" /><p class="p">The argument <samp class="ph codeph">group</samp> contains a reference to the newly 
created group, which contains all the jobs of all the environments of all 
the remote objects stored in the argument <samp class="ph codeph">env</samp>. After 
that group is created, it is possible to read the data file and 
multicast it to all remote objects in the group, as in the 
following lines of code.</p>
<img class="image" src="../../../images/egRemoteObj_read_multicast.jpg" /><p class="p">Those lines of code read the file locally into memory 
and then send this memory block to all remote objects in the group. 
The remote objects then parse the memory
block as if it were a file, and thereby each remote object 
loads the respective model.  After 
<span class="keyword apiname">CPXXreadcopyprob_multicast</span>
returns, all remote objects in the group
will have loaded the exact same model.</p>
<p class="p">This example also sets the number of threads in each remote object 
to 1 (one). This setting reduces machine load in case all "remote" machines are
in fact the same local host.</p>
<p class="p">To perform yet another operation (this time, setting the number of threads) 
in exactly the same way on every remote object, 
the example again uses a group and multicast in the following lines of code.</p>
<img class="image" src="../../../images/egRemoteObj_threads_multicast.jpg" /><p class="p">The following line deletes the group after the group is no longer needed.</p>
