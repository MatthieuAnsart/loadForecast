<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains special considerations about the change of the problem type of a quadratic program.</p>
<p class="p"> 
Situations in which you must change the problem type of your model arise, for example, when you remove 
quadratic terms from the objective function of a QP or when you add a quadratic term to the objective
function of a linear program (LP). This topic highlights whether and how to change problem type 
according to the CPLEX component that you use (Concert Technology, Python API, Callable Library, 
Interactive Optimizer).  </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Concert Technology</strong> (that
is, applications written in the C++, Java, or .NET API of CPLEX) treats
all models as capable of containing quadratic coefficients in the
objective function. These coefficients can therefore be added or deleted
at will. When extracting a model with a quadratic objective function,
CPLEX will automatically detect it as a QP and make the required adjustments
to data structures. Likewise, in the <strong class="ph b">Python API</strong>,
CPLEX treats all models as capable of containing quadratic coefficients
in the objective function.</p>
<p class="p">However, the other ways of using CPLEX (the <strong class="ph b">Callable
Library</strong> and the <strong class="ph b">Interactive Optimizer</strong>)
require an explicit <em class="ph i">problem type</em> to
distinguish a linear program (LP) from a QP. The following sections
discuss the topic for these users.</p>
<p class="p">When you enter a problem, CPLEX discovers the problem
type from the available information. When read from a file (LP, MPS,
or SAV format, for example), or entered interactively, a continuous
optimization problem is usually treated as being of type QP if quadratic
coefficients are present in the objective function and no quadratic
terms are present among the constraints. (Quadratic terms among the
constraints may make a problem of type QCP. For more about that type,
see <a class="xref" href="../qcp/01_QCP_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents the solution of quadratically constrained programming problems (QCPs), including the special case of second order cone programming problems (SOCPs).">Solving problems with quadratic constraints (QCP)</a>.) Otherwise, the problem type is usually
LP. The issue of problem types that support integer restrictions in
conjunction with quadratic variables is discussed in <a class="xref" href="../../discr_optim/mip/01_mip_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents the solution of mixed integer programs (MIPs) with the CPLEX mixed integer optimizer; that is, solving models in which one or more variables must take integer solution values.">Solving mixed integer programming problems (MIP)</a>.</p>
<p class="p">If you enter a problem that lacks any quadratic coefficients,
its <em class="ph i">problem type</em> is
initially LP. If you then wish to modify the problem to contain quadratic
coefficients in the objective function, you do this by first changing
the problem type to QP. Conversely, if you have entered a QP model
and wish to remove all the quadratic coefficients from the objective
function and thus convert the model to an LP, you must also change
the problem type to LP. Note that deleting each of the quadratic coefficients
individually still leaves the problem type as QP, although in most
instances the distinction between this problem and its LP or QP counterpart
is somewhat arbitrary in terms of the steps to solve it.</p>
<p class="p">When using the <strong class="ph b">Interactive Optimizer</strong>,
you use the command <samp class="ph codeph">change problem</samp>  with
one of the following options:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">lp</samp> indicates
that you want CPLEX to treat the problem as an LP. This change in
Problem Type removes from your problem all the quadratic information,
if there is any present.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">qp</samp> indicates
that you want CPLEX to treat the problem as a QP. This change in Problem
Type creates in your problem an empty quadratic matrix, if there is
not one already present, for the objective function, ready for populating
via the <samp class="ph codeph">change qpterm</samp> command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">From the <strong class="ph b">Callable Library</strong>,
use the routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXchgprobtype</samp> to change
the problem type to either <samp class="ph codeph">CPXPROB_LP</samp> for
the LP case or <samp class="ph codeph">CPXPROB_QP</samp> for the QP case
for the same purposes.</p>
