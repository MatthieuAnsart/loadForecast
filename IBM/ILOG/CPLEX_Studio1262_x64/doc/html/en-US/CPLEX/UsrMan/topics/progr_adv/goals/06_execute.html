<h1 class="title topictitle1">About the method execute in a goal</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the execute method of a goal.</p>
<p class="p">Typically, the implementation of the method <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp> 
will perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">Check feasibility. An interesting possibility
here is that the feasibility check may include more than verifying
integrality of the solution. This allows you to enforce constraints
that could not reasonably be expressed using linear constraints through
cuts or branching. In other words, this allows you to use goals in
a way that makes them part of the model to be solved. Such a use is
common in Constraint Programming, but it is less frequently used in
Mathematical Programming. Note, however, that this CP-style application
of goals prevents you from making use of MP-style advanced starting
information, either from a MIP Start file or by restarting a previous
optimization with one that uses goals.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Optionally find local or global cuts
to be added. Local cuts will be respected only for the subtree below
the current node, whereas global cuts will be enforced for all nodes
from then on.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Optionally construct a solution and
pass it to CPLEX.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Instruct CPLEX how to proceed. Instruct
CPLEX how to proceed through the return value of the method <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp>;
the return value of <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp> is another
goal. CPLEX simply continues by executing this goal.</p>
