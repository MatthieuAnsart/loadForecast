<h1 class="title topictitle1">Infeasible solution information</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes methods of the Java API to access information
about an infeasible solution.</p>
<p class="p">An important feature of CPLEX is that even if no feasible
solution has been found, (that is, if <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.solve</samp> returns <samp class="ph codeph">false</samp>),
some information about the problem can still be queried. All the methods
discussed so far may successfully return information about the current
(infeasible) solution that CPLEX maintains.</p>
<p class="p">Unfortunately, there is no simple comprehensive rule
about whether or not current solution information can be queried.
This is because by default, CPLEX uses a presolve procedure to simplify
the model. If, for example, the model is proven to be infeasible during
the presolve, no current solution is generated by the optimizer. If,
in contrast, infeasibility is only proven by the optimizer, current
solution information is available to be queried. The status returned
by calling <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.getCplexStatus</samp> may help
you decide which case you are facing, but it is probably safer and
easier to include the methods for querying the solution within <samp class="ph codeph">try / catch</samp> statements.</p>
<p class="p">The method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.isPrimalFeasible</samp> can
be called to learn whether a primal feasible solution has been found
and can be queried. Similarly, the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.isDualFeasible</samp> can
be called to learn whether a dual feasible solution has been found
and can be queried.</p>
<p class="p">When an LP has been proven to be infeasible, CPLEX provides
assistance for investigating the cause of the infeasibility through
two different approaches: the conflict refiner and FeasOpt. </p>
<p class="p">One approach, invoked by the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.refineConflict</samp>,
computes a minimal set of conflicting constraints and bounds and reports
them to you for you to take action to remove the conflict from your
infeasible model. For more about this approach, see <a class="xref" href="../../infeas_unbd/conflict_refiner/01_ref_confl_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes the conflict refiner, a feature for diagnosing the cause of infeasibility in a model, whether continuous or discrete, whether linear or quadratic.">Diagnosing infeasibility by refining conflicts</a>.</p>
<p class="p">Another approach to consider is the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.feasOpt</samp> to
explore whether there are modifications you can make that would render
your model feasible. <a class="xref" href="../../cont_optim/simplex/26_feasopt.html" title="Introduces FeasOpt as a tool for repairing infeasibility in LP models.">Repairing infeasibility: FeasOpt</a> explains
that feature of CPLEX more fully, with examples of its use.</p>
