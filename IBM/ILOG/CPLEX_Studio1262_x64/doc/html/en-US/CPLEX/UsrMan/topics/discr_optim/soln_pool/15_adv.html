<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains when to invoke the populate procedure.</p>
<p class="p">Should you call MIP optimization and then populate, or
should you call populate alone? </p>
<p class="p">You can call populate after you call the MIP optimizer,
or you can call populate on its own after you read or create a model.
In order to decide which to do, you need to know more about the two
procedures.</p>
<p class="p">Recall that the algorithm underlying populate works in
two phases. If you call the MIP optimizer after the model is read,
it will gather and store information about the search as it solves
the model. In practice, its activity constitutes the first phase of
the populate algorithm. In the general case, if you then call populate,
populate will re-use the information stored by the MIP optimizer and
carry out only the second phase.</p>
<p class="p">In contrast, if you call populate immediately after the
model is read, populate will perform both the first phase and the
second phase.</p>
<p class="p">If you specify a nondefault setting of the pool intensity
parameter, then calling the MIP optimizer and afterwards calling populate
will give the same results in terms of performance and solutions generated
as calling populate alone. (The exception to this generalization occurs
when the pool intensity parameter is set at its default value, 0 (zero)
that is, automatic. For details about that case, see the documentation
of the solution pool intensity parameter.)</p>
<p class="p">Calling populate alone is simpler than calling populate
after MIP optimization. However, if you want more control over the
details of the two phases (for example, if you want to specify different
stopping criteria for each phase), then you need to call MIP optimization
followed by populate, instead of calling populate alone. The risk
associated with this approach is that populate might not be able to
reuse the information about the tree from the previous MIP optimization;
in that case, populate will start from scratch; that is, it again
performs the first phase, followed by the second phase. In particular,
this repetition of the first phase will happen if you increase the
pool intensity parameter between the call to MIP optimization and
the call to populate.</p>
<p class="p">More information about this topic can be found in the
documentation about the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/SolnPoolIntensity.html" title="Controls the trade-off between the number of solutions generated for the solution pool and the amount of time or memory consumed.">solution pool intensity</a> parameter
(<samp class="ph codeph">SolnPoolIntensity</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_SOLNPOOLINTENSITY</samp>)
in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX</em> <em class="ph i">Parameters Reference Manual</em>.</p>
<p class="p">In short, if you want the simplicity of a black box,
call populate alone; if you need more control, call MIP optimization,
then populate.</p>
