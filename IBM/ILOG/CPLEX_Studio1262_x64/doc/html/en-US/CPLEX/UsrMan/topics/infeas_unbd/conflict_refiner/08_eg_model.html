<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes a model to exercise the conflict refiner in
the Interactive Optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">Here’s a simplified resource allocation problem
to use as a model in the Interactive Optimizer. Either you can create
a file containing these lines and read the file into the Interactive
Optimizer by means of this command:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">read </samp> <em class="ph i">filename</em> </p>
<p class="p">or you can use the <samp class="ph codeph">enter</samp> 
command, followed by a name for the problem, followed by these lines:
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Minimize

 c1:  - cost + 80 x1 + 60 x2 + 55 x3 + 30 x4 + 25 x5 + 80 x6 + 60 x7 + 35 x8
      + 80 x9 + 55 x10  = 0

<p class="p">This simple model, for example, might represent a project-staffing
problem. In that case, the ten binary variables could represent employees
who could be assigned to duty.</p>
<p class="p">The first constraint defines the cost function. In this
example, the objective is to minimize the cost of salaries. The next
three constraints (c2, c3, c4) represent three nonoverlapping skills
that the employees must cover to varying degrees of ability. The fifth
constraint represents some additional quality metric (perhaps hard
to measure) that most or all of the employees can contribute to. It
is called customer service in this example. That variable has a lower
bound to make sure of a certain predefined minimum level of 3.2.</p>
<p class="p">The remaining constraints represent various work rules
that reflect either policy that must be followed or practical guidance
based on experience with this work force. Constraint c6, for example,
dictates that at least one person with managerial authority be present.
Constraint c7 requires at least two senior personnel be present. Constraint
c8 indicates that several people are scheduled for off-site training
during this period. Constraint c9 recognizes that three individuals
are not productive together. Constraint c10 prevents two employees
who are married to each other from working in this group in the same
period, since one is a manager.</p>
