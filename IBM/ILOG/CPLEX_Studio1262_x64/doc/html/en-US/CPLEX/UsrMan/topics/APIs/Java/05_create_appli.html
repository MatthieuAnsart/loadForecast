<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Introduces the componets of an application in the Java
API of Concert Technology and covers the steps most Java applications
are likely to follow.</p>
<p class="p">First, create a model of your problem with the modeling
facilities of Concert Technology. <a class="xref" href="06_modeling_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes classes in the Java API to model an optimization problem.">Modeling an optimization problem with Concert Technology in the Java API</a> offers
an introduction to creating a model. <a class="xref" href="10_build_model.html" title="Uses the diet example to demonstrate building a model for CPLEX in Java.">Building the model</a> goes into more detail.</p>
<p class="p">When the model is ready to be solved, hand it over to
 CPLEX for solving. <a class="xref" href="11_solve_model.html" title="Describes the class IloCplex in the Java API.">Solving the model</a> explains
how to do so. It includes a survey of the <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> interface
for controlling the optimization. Individual controls are discussed
in the chapters explaining the individual optimizers. </p>
<p class="p"> <a class="xref" href="12_access_soln.html" title="Describes the information available in the Java API about a solution.">Accessing solution information</a> shows
you how to access and interpret results from the optimization after
solving the model. </p>
<p class="p">After analyzing the results, you may want to make changes
to the model and study their effect. <a class="xref" href="34_modify_model.html" title="Describes modification of a model in the Java API.">Modifying the model</a> explains
how to make changes and how CPLEX deals with them in the context of
the diet problem. </p>
<p class="p"> <a class="xref" href="33_diet_eg.html" title="Describes an application to solve the diet problem in the Java API.">Example: optimizing the diet problem in Java</a> presents
a complete program. </p>
<p class="p">Not covered in this chapter are advanced features, such
as the use of goals or callbacks to query data about an ongoing optimization
and for controlling the optimization itself. Goals, callbacks, and
other advanced features are discussed in <a class="xref" href="../../progr_adv/partAdvProg_title_synopsis.html" title="This part documents advanced programming techniques for users of IBM ILOG CPLEX. It shows you how to apply query routines to gather information while CPLEX is working. It demonstrates how to redirect the search with goals or callbacks. This part also covers user-defined cuts and pools of lazy constraints. It documents the advanced MIP control interface and the advanced aspects of preprocessing: presolve and aggregation. It also introduces special considerations about parallel programming with CPLEX. This part of the manual assumes that you are already familiar with earlier parts of the manual.">Advanced programming techniques</a>.</p>
