<h1 class="title topictitle1">Analyzing MIP solution quality</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes analysis of the quality of a solution of a MIP
optimization.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX can also display information about the quality of a MIP solution.
 Here is a sample, typical of such quality information.</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>MILP objective                                -2.1989035553e+06
MILP solution norm |x| (Total, Max)            1.95445e+10  1.68134e+08
MILP solution error (Ax=b) (Total, Max)        3.90105e+05  8.14760e+03
MILP x bound error (Total, Max)                0.00000e+00  0.00000e+00
MILP x integrality error (Total, Max)          1.96296e-06  9.81482e-07
MILP slack bound error (Total, Max)            8.27493e-08  2.95847e-09</code></pre>
<p class="p">Because a MIP solution lacks an associated unique basis matrix,
no  measures of dual variable solution quality or reduced cost solution
quality are  available for a MIP solution.  However, as you see in
that sample,  CPLEX provides norms of primal variable values, bound
violations,  and associated residuals in much the same way as for
LP solutions.  For more detail about those qualities, see the topic
 <a class="xref" href="../../../cont_optim/simplex/24_soln_quality.html" title="Documents facilities for evaluating solution quality in LP models.">Interpreting solution quality</a> </p>
<p class="p"> Furthermore, the integrality error declares the maximum amount
by  which the solution value of a variable restricted to be integral
has violated its integrality restriction. By default, CPLEX uses a
default  value of integrality tolerance of 1e-05. (You can adjust
this value by  means of the  <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/EpInt.html" title="Specifies the amount by which an integer variable can be different from an integer and still be considered feasible.">integrality tolerance</a>  parameter.) </p>
<p class="p"> The MILP slack bound error recomputes the slack or artificial
variable values based on the structural variable values in the solution.
 The MILP slack bound error  corresponds to the slack values that
would be obtained from all the slack values in the basis of the  fixed
LP associated with the MILP solution.   Any resulting violation of
the bounds of these slack variables that exceeds the feasibility tolerance
indicates potential for better solution quality if you address ill-conditioning
in the model.   </p>
<p class="p">The slack bound error differs from the primal residual solution
error <samp class="ph codeph">Ax - b</samp>. Specifically, 
the <strong class="ph b">slack bound error</strong> involves recomputing the slacks; 
in contrast, the <strong class="ph b">primal residual solution error</strong> 
computes residuals based on the structural 
and slack values obtained from the node relaxation or heuristic 
from which the final integer solution was computed.
 These two metrics (slack bound error and primal residual solution
error), along with the integrality error, are the most important measures
of MIP solution quality.  </p>
<p class="p">As an example of analyzing the quality of a solution, consider
this model:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>10000x + y &gt;= 10000
x &gt;= 1
y &gt;= 0 
x,y integer</code></pre>
<p class="p">For the solution <samp class="ph codeph">x = 1 - 1e-10, y = 0</samp>,   the integrality
error is <samp class="ph codeph">1e-10</samp>. The MIP slack bound violation is
obtained by comparing the lefthand side of the solution value,<samp class="ph codeph"> 10000*(1-1e-10)</samp>,
 to the righthand side of <samp class="ph codeph">10000</samp>.  The difference
 implies a value of <samp class="ph codeph">-1e-6</samp> for the surplus variable
on the constraint, a slack bound violation of  <samp class="ph codeph">1e-6</samp>.
In other words, constraint coefficients larger than one can magnify
a bound  violation for a structural variable into a larger slack bound
violation.</p>
