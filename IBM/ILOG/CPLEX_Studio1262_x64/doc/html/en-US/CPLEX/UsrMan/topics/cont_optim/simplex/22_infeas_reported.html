in LP models.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX reports statistics about any problem that it optimizes.
For infeasible solutions, it reports values that you can analyze to
discover where your problem formulation proved infeasible. In certain
situations, you can then alter your problem formulation or change
CPLEX parameters to achieve a satisfactory solution.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">When the CPLEX primal simplex optimizer
terminates with an infeasible basic solution, it calculates dual variables
and reduced costs relative to the Phase I objective function;
that is, relative to the infeasibility function. The Phase I
objective function depends on the current basis. Consequently, if
you use the primal simplex optimizer with various parameter settings,
an infeasible problem will produce different objective values and
different solutions.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">In the case of the dual simplex optimizer,
termination with a status of infeasibility occurs only during Phase
II. Therefore, all solution values are relative to the problem's natural
(primal) formulation, including the values related to the objective
function, such as the dual variables and reduced costs. As with the
primal simplex optimizer, the basis in which the detection of infeasibility
occurred may not be unique.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">CPLEX provides tools to help you analyze the source of
the infeasibility in your model. Those tools include the conflict
refiner and FeasOpt:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The conflict refiner is invoked by the
routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXrefineconflict</samp> in the Callable
Library or by the method <samp class="ph codeph">refineConflict</samp> in
Concert Technology. It finds a set of conflicting constraints and
bounds in a model and refines the set to be minimal in a sense that
you declare. It then reports its findings for you to take action to
repair that conflict in your infeasible model. For more about this
feature, see <a class="xref" href="../../infeas_unbd/conflict_refiner/01_ref_confl_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes the conflict refiner, a feature for diagnosing the cause of infeasibility in a model, whether continuous or discrete, whether linear or quadratic.">Diagnosing infeasibility by refining conflicts</a>.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">FeasOpt is implemented in the Callable
Library by the routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXfeasopt</samp> and in
Concert Technology by the method <samp class="ph codeph">feasOpt</samp>.
For more about this feature, see <a class="xref" href="26_feasopt.html" title="Introduces FeasOpt as a tool for repairing infeasibility in LP models.">Repairing infeasibility: FeasOpt</a>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">With the help of those tools, you may be able to modify
your problem to avoid infeasibility.</p>
