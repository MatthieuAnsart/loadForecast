<h1 class="title topictitle1">Determinism of results</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Defines determinism and describes its effect in parallel optimization.</p>
<p class="p">By default, CPLEX employs parallel algorithms only as
long as the optimization remains deterministic. In this context, <strong class="ph b">deterministic</strong> means that repeated
solving of the same model with the same parameter settings, including <strong class="ph b">limits</strong>,
on the same computing platform will follow exactly the same solution
path, yielding the same level of performance and the same values in
the solution. </p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> <p class="p">CPLEX real time limits (also known as wall clock time) 
depend on system time. 
<strong class="ph b">System time is not deterministic.</strong> 
In other words, system time may vary from one run to another. 
Consequently, two consecutive runs even
with the same time limit may yield results that are not deterministic.
In contrast, CPLEX deterministic time limits do not depend on system time.
Consequently, two consecutive runs with the same 
deterministic time limit will follow the same solution path.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Two parallel implementations are available in CPLEX:
deterministic and opportunistic. Opportunistic parallel optimization
requires less synchronization between threads and thus offers better
performance on average. Consequently, during development of an application,
you may find deterministic parallelism advantageous for the repeatable,
invariant solution path and results, whereas after development, during
application deployment, you may prefer opportunistic parallelism for
its performance.</p>
<p class="p">To maintain determinism (that is, an implicit contract
of repeatable, invariant search path and results), CPLEX invokes deterministic
parallelism by default for MIP optimization.</p>
<p class="p">In addition to the threads parameter, you can use the 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/ParallelMode.html" title="Sets the parallel optimization mode. Possible modes are automatic, deterministic, and opportunistic.">parallel mode switch</a> 
(<samp class="ph codeph">ParallelMode</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_PARALLELMODE</samp>)
to control the invocation of opportunistic algorithms. With its default
setting of 0 (zero), only deterministic algorithms are used, unless
the threads parameter is changed to a value strictly greater than
one. </p>
<p class="p">To force CPLEX to use deterministic algorithms in all
cases, set the parallel mode parameter to 1 (one).</p>
<p class="p">To allow CPLEX to use opportunistic algorithms in all
situations, set the parallel mode parameter to -1 (minus one).</p>
<p class="p">The presence of a time limit, set by the 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/TiLim.html" title="Sets the maximum time, in seconds, for a call to an optimizer.">optimizer time limit in seconds</a> parameter
(<samp class="ph codeph">TiLim</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_TILIM</samp>)
for example, poses problems for reproducibility in any algorithm that
is otherwise deterministic, even in sequential rather than parallel
mode. Subtle variations in runtime on computer architectures can lead
to variation in the measurement of time. (Other limits, such as node
limits, are not subject to this variability.) </p>
<p class="p">Because time limits are so important in many applications,
CPLEX will still attempt to use deterministic mode without regard
to whether a time limit is in effect. While variability will still
be much lower than with the opportunistic setting, the user is advised
that complete determinism within time limits can not be assured.</p>
<p class="p">There are other features of CPLEX that also depend implicitly
on computer run time. Because of this implicit dependence, they too
can pose problems for reproducibility in otherwise deterministic algorithms.
 Examples include terminating the optimization, using a termination
signal in a callback, or any other use of a callback where behavior
varies according to the order in which the callbacks are invoked on
multiple threads.  In fact, the subtle variations in computer run
time can alter the order in which the threads invoke a callback on
consecutive runs.</p>
