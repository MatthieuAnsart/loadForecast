<h1 class="title topictitle1">Difficulties during optimization</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Suggests strategies for overcoming difficulties during
optimization with the barrier optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">Numeric difficulties can degrade performance of the CPLEX
barrier optimizer or even prevent convergence toward a solution. There
are several possible sources of numeric difficulties:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">elimination of too many dense columns
may cause numeric instability;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">tight convergence tolerance may aggravate
small numeric inconsistencies in a problem;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">unbounded optimal faces may remain undetected
and thus prevent convergence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The following subsections offer guidance about overcoming
those difficulties.</p>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveBarrier.654282__User_manual.uss_solveBarrier.654293"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Numeric instability due to elimination of too many dense
columns</h2><p class="p"> <a class="xref" href="23_dense_cols.html" title="Explains the effect of dense columns in the model on performance of the barrier optimizer.">Detecting and eliminating dense columns</a> explains
how to change parameters to encourage CPLEX to detect and eliminate
as many dense columns as possible. However, in some problems, if CPLEX
removes too many dense columns, it may cause numeric instability. </p>
<p class="p">You can check how many dense columns CPLEX removes by
looking at the preprocessing statistics at the beginning of the log
file. For example, the following log file shows that CPLEX removed
2249 columns, of which nine were dense.  </p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Selected objective sense:  MINIMIZE
Selected objective  name:  obj
Selected RHS        name:  rhs
Selected bound      name:  bnd

Problem 'XXX.mps' read.
Read time =    0.03 sec. (0.69 ticks)
Tried aggregator 1 time.
LP Presolve eliminated 2200 rows and 2249 columns.
Aggregator did 8 substitutions.
Reduced LP has 171 rows, 182 columns, and 1077 nonzeros.
Presolve time =    0.02 sec. (0.46 ticks)

***NOTE: Found 9 dense columns.

Number of nonzeros in lower triangle of A*A' = 6071
Using Approximate Minimum Degree ordering
Total time for automatic ordering = 0.00 sec. (0.23 ticks)
Summary statistics for Cholesky factor:
  Rows in Factor            = 180
  Integer space required    = 313
  Total non-zeros in factor = 7286
  Total FP ops to factor    = 416448</code></pre>


<p class="p">If you observe that the removal of too many dense columns
results in numeric instability in your problem, then increase the
column nonzeros parameter, <samp class="ph codeph">BarColNz</samp>. </p>

<p class="p">The default value of the column nonzeros parameter is <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp> 
(zero); that value tells CPLEX to calculate the parameter automatically.</p>

<p class="p">To see the current value of the column nonzeros parameter
(either one you have set or one CPLEX has automatically calculated)
you need to look at the level two display, by setting the <samp class="ph codeph">BarDisplay</samp> parameter
to <samp class="ph codeph">2</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">If you decide that the current value of the column nonzeros
parameter is inappropriate for your problem and thus tells CPLEX to
remove too many dense columns, then you can increase the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">BarColNz</samp> to
keep the number of dense columns removed low.</p>

<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveBarrier.654282__User_manual.uss_solveBarrier.654349"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Small numeric inconsistencies and tight convergence tolerance</h2>




<p class="p">If your problem contains small numeric inconsistencies,
it may be difficult for the CPLEX barrier optimizer to achieve a satisfactory
solution at the default setting of the complementarity convergence
tolerance. In such a case, you should increase the convergence tolerance
parameter (<samp class="ph codeph">BarEpComp</samp> for LP or QP models, <samp class="ph codeph">BarQCPEpComp</samp> for
QCP models). </p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveBarrier.654282__User_manual.uss_solveBarrier.654370"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Unbounded variables and unbounded optimal faces</h2>





<p class="p">An unbounded optimal face occurs in a model that contains
a sequence of optimal solutions, all with the same value for the objective
function and unbounded variable values. The CPLEX barrier optimizer
will fail to terminate normally if an undetected unbounded optimal
face exists.</p>

<p class="p">Normally, the CPLEX barrier optimizer uses its barrier
growth parameter, <samp class="ph codeph">BarGrowth</samp> , to detect
such conditions. If this parameter is increased beyond its default
value, the CPLEX barrier optimizer will be less likely to detect that
the problem has an unbounded optimal face and more likely to encounter
numeric difficulties.</p>

<p class="p">Consequently, you should change the barrier growth parameter
only if you find that the CPLEX barrier optimizer is terminating its
work before it finds the true optimum because it has falsely detected
an unbounded face.</p>
