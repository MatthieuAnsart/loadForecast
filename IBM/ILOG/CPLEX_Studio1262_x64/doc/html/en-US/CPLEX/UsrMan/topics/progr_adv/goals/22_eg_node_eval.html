<h1 class="title topictitle1">Example: using node evaluators in a node selection strategy</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Illustrates node evaluators in a node selection strategy.</p>
<p class="p">The example <samp class="ph codeph">ilogoalex3.cpp</samp> shows
how to use node evaluators to implement a node selection strategy
that chooses the deepest active node in the tree among those nodes
with a maximal sum of integer infeasibilities. The example <samp class="ph codeph">ilogoalex3.cpp</samp> can
be found in the <samp class="ph codeph">examples/src</samp>  directory
of your distribution. The equivalent <strong class="ph b">Java</strong> implementation
can be found in the file <samp class="ph codeph">Goalex3.java</samp> at
the same location. Likewise, the <strong class="ph b">C#.NET</strong> example
is available in <samp class="ph codeph">Goalex3.cs</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">As this example is an extension of the example <samp class="ph codeph">ilogoalex1.cpp</samp>,
this exposition of it concentrates only on their differences. Also,
the example is discussed only in terms of the C++ implementation;
the Java implementation has identical structure and design and differs
only in syntax, as does the .NET as well.</p>
<p class="p">The first difference is the definition of class <samp class="ph codeph">DepthEvaluatorI</samp> as
a subclass of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::NodeEvaluatorI</samp>.
It implements the methods <samp class="ph codeph">evaluate</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">duplicateEvaluator</samp>.
The method <samp class="ph codeph">evaluate</samp> simply returns the
negative depth value queried for the current node by calling method <samp class="ph codeph">getDepth</samp>.
Since CPLEX by default chooses nodes with the lowest evaluation value,
this evaluator will favor nodes deep in the tree. The method <samp class="ph codeph">duplicateEvaluator</samp> simply
returns a copy of the invoking object by calling the (default) copy
constructor. Along with the class, the function <samp class="ph codeph">DepthEvaluator</samp> is
also defined to create an instance of class <samp class="ph codeph">DepthEvaluatorI</samp> and
return a handle to it.</p>
<p class="p">Similarly, the class <samp class="ph codeph">IISumEvaluatorI</samp> and
function <samp class="ph codeph">IISumEvaluator</samp> are also defined.
The <samp class="ph codeph">evaluate</samp>  method returns the negation
of the sum of integer infeasibilities of the node being evaluated.
This number is obtained by calling method <samp class="ph codeph">getInfeasibilitySum</samp>.
Thus, this evaluator favors nodes with larger sums of integer infeasibilities.</p>
<p class="p">This example uses the same search strategy as <samp class="ph codeph">ilogoalex1.cpp</samp>,
implemented in goal <samp class="ph codeph">MyBranchGoal</samp>. However,
it applies first the <samp class="ph codeph">IISumEvaluator</samp> to
select nodes with a high integer infeasibility sum; to choose between
nodes with the same integer infeasibility sum, it applies the <samp class="ph codeph">DepthEvaluator</samp>.
Application of the <samp class="ph codeph">IISumEvaluator</samp> is done
with: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloCplex::Goal iiSumGoal = IloCplex::Apply(cplex,
                                           MyBranchGoal(env, var),
                                           IISumEvaluator());</code></pre>
<p class="p">The goal created by calling <samp class="ph codeph">MyBranchGoal</samp> is
merged with the evaluator created by calling <samp class="ph codeph">IISumEvaluator</samp> in
a new goal <samp class="ph codeph">iiSumGoal</samp>. Similarly, the goal <samp class="ph codeph">iiSumGoal</samp> 
is merged with the node evaluator created by calling <samp class="ph codeph">DepthEvaluator</samp> into
a new goal <samp class="ph codeph">depthGoal</samp>: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloCplex::Goal depthGoal = IloCplex::Apply(cplex,
                                           iiSumGoal,
                                           DepthEvaluator());</code></pre>
<p class="p">Thus, <samp class="ph codeph">depthGoal</samp> represents
a goal implementing the branching strategy defined by <samp class="ph codeph">MyBranchGoal</samp>,
but using <samp class="ph codeph">IISumEvaluator</samp> as a primary node
selection strategy and <samp class="ph codeph">DepthEvaluator</samp> as
a secondary node selection strategy for breaking ties. This goal is
finally used for the branch &amp; cut search by passing
it to the <samp class="ph codeph">solve</samp> method.</p>
<p class="p">Node evaluators are only active while the search is controlled
by goals. That is, if the goal stack becomes empty at a node and CPLEX
continues searching with its built-in search strategy, that search
is no longer controlled by any node evaluator. In order to maintain
control over the node selection strategy while using the CPLEX branch
strategy, you can use the goal returned by the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI::BranchAsCplexGoal</samp> 
(<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.branchAsCplex</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">CplexBranchAsCplex</samp>).
A goal that follows the branching performed by the built-in strategy
of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> can be easily implemented as: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILOCPLEXGOAL0(DefaultSearchGoal) {
  if ( !isIntegerFeasible() )
    return AndGoal(BranchAsCplexGoal(getEnv()), this);
  return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p class="p">Notice the test for integer feasibility. Without that
test, the application would create an endless loop because when an
integer feasible solution has been found, the goal <samp class="ph codeph">BranchAsCplex </samp>does
not change the node at all, and <samp class="ph codeph">this</samp>  would
continue to be executed indefinitely.</p>
