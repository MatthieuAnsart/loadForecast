<p class="p">There is one exception to the PSD requirement; that is,
there is an additional form of quadratic constraint which is accepted
but is not covered by the general formulation in

Technically, the class of quadratically constrained problems that the barrier optimizer
solves is a Second-Order Cone Program (SOCP). CPLEX, through its preprocessing
feature, carries out the translation to SOCP for you, transparently,
returning the solution in terms of your original formulation. A constraint
will be accepted for solution by the barrier optimizer if it can be
transformed to the following convex second-order cone constraint:</p>

<p class="p">CPLEX automatically transforms quadratic constraints of
these types into second order cone constraints:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>x'Qx &lt;= y² where y &gt;= 0 and Q is PSD</code></pre>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>x'Qx &lt;= yz where y &gt;= 0 , z &gt;= 0, and Q is PSD</code></pre>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p">When Q is the identity matrix, that formulation
is known as a rotated cone. CPLEX automatically translates those formulations
as well and solves the rotated cone program for you transparently.</p>

also the topic <a class="xref" href="19_eg_SOCP_location.html" title="Lists examples of SOCP.">Examples: SOCP</a>. For suggestions
about accessing dual values and reduced costs of SOCP models, see
