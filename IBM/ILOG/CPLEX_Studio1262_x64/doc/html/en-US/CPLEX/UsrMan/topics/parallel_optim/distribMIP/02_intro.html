<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Introduces the algorithm for optimization of a mixed integer program (MIP) 
in a distributed computing environment.</p>
<p class="p">The topic 
<a class="xref" href="../remote_obj/00_remote_obj_synopsis.html" title="Introduces the remote object available in CPLEX for distributed parallel optimization.">Remote object for distributed parallel optimization</a>
introduced the idea of a remote object to support distributed parallel applications 
of CPLEX optimizers. </p>
<p class="p">This topic goes further in that direction, introducing the 
CPLEX algorithm to support a distributed application designed to solve 
a mixed integer program (MIP) in parallel. Specifically, this topic outlines an  
algorithm that implements a variation of branch and bound suitable for application 
across multiple machines (or multiple nodes of a single machine) to solve a difficult 
mixed integer program (MIP) in parallel.</p>
<p class="p">This distributed parallel MIP algorithm runs on a single master associated with multiple workers. 
The master and the workers can be physical or virtual machines. Indeed, in this context, a 
virtual machine may simply be a process in the operating system of a machine. Throughout the 
runtime of this algorithm, the master coordinates the workers, and the workers perform the 
"heavy lifting" (that is, the actual solving of the MIP).</p>
<p class="p">The algorithm begins by presolving the MIP on the master. After presolving, the algorithm sends 
the reduced model to each of the workers.</p>
<p class="p">Each of the workers then starts to solve the reduced model. Each worker has its own 
parameter settings, possibly different from the parameter settings of other workers. Each worker 
solves the reduced model with its own parameter settings for a limited period of time. 
This phase is known as <strong class="ph b">ramp up</strong>.  During ramp up, each worker conducts its own search, 
according to its own parameter settings. 
Ramp up stops when the master concludes that at 
least one of the workers has created a sufficiently large search tree.</p>
<p class="p">At that point, when ramp up stops, the master decides which of the workers performed best. 
In other words, the master selects a winner. The parameter settings used by the winning worker 
during ramp up  
are the basis for the master to determine which parameter settings to use in the ensuing 
distributed branch and bound search.</p>
<p class="p">The search tree on each of the non-winning workers is deleted. The search tree of the winning 
worker is distributed over all workers, so that authentic distributed parallel branch and bound 
starts from this point.  In other words, all workers now work on the same search tree, with the 
master coordinating the search in the distributed tree.</p>
