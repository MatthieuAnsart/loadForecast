<h1 class="title topictitle1">Example: network to LP transformation netex2.c</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Demonstrates an example of converting a network flow model
to its LP model in the C API.</p>
<p class="p">This example shows how to transform a network-flow problem into
its corresponding LP formulation. That example also indicates why
you might want to make such a change. The example reads a network-flow
problem from a file (rather than populating the problem object by
adding rows and columns as in <samp class="ph codeph">netex1.c</samp> ). You can
find the data of this example in the file <samp class="ph codeph">examples/data/infnet.net</samp> .
After reading the data from that file, the example then attempts to
solve the problem by calling the Callable Library routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/netapi/NETprimopt.html" title="The routine CPXXNETprimopt/CPXNETprimopt can be called after a network problem has been copied to a network problem object, to find a solution to that problem using the primal network simplex method.">CPXNETprimopt</a></samp>.
If it detects that the problem is infeasible, it then invokes the
conflict refiner to analyze the problem and possibly indicate the
cause of the infeasibility. </p>
<p class="p">The complete program <samp class="ph codeph">netex2.c</samp> appears online in
the standard distribution at <em class="ph i">yourCPLEXinstallation</em> <samp class="ph codeph">/examples/src</samp>.</p>
