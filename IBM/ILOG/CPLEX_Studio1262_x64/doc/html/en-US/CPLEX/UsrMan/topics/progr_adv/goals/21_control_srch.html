<h1 class="title topictitle1">Controlling goal-defined search</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes node selection strategy with goals.</p>
<p class="p">So far, you have seen how to control the branching and
cut generation of CPLEX branch &amp; cut search. The remaining
missing piece is the node selection strategy. The node selection strategy
sets which of the active nodes in the tree CPLEX chooses when it selects
the next node for processing. CPLEX has several built-in node selection
strategies, selected through the node selection parameter <samp class="ph codeph">(NodeSel</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_NODESEL</samp>).</p>
<p class="p">When you use goal-controlled search, you use node evaluators
to override the built-in node selection strategy. You combine a goal
with a node evaluator by calling the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::Goal::Apply</samp> (<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.apply</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.Apply</samp>).
This method returns a new goal that implements the same search strategy
as the goal passed as the argument, but adds the node evaluator to
every node in the subtree defined by the goal. Consequently, nodes
may have a list of evaluators attached to them.</p>
<p class="p">When node evaluators are used, nodes are selected like
this: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">CPLEX starts to choose the node with
the built-in strategy as a first candidate.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Then CPLEX loops over all remaining
active nodes and considers choosing them instead. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If a node has the same evaluator attached
to it as the current candidate, the evaluator is asked whether this
node should take precedence over the current candidate. If the response
is positive, the node under investigation becomes the new candidate,
and the test against other nodes continues.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">If a node has multiple evaluators attached, they are
consulted in the order the evaluators have been applied. Here is the
application order: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">If the first evaluator prefers one node
over the other, the preferred node is used as candidate and the next
node is considered. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If the first evaluator does not give
preference to one node over the other, the second evaluator is considered,
and so on. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Thus, by adding multiple evaluators, you can build composite
node selection strategies where later evaluators are used for breaking
ties in previous evaluations.</p>
<p class="p">In the C++ API, node evaluators are implemented as subclasses
of class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::NodeEvaluatorI</samp>. The
class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::NodeEvaluator</samp> is the handle
class for node evaluators. </p>
<p class="p">In <strong class="ph b">Java</strong>, node evaluators
are implemented in objects of type <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.NodeEvaluator</samp> 
(and there are no handle classes). Likewise, in the .NET API, node
evaluators are implemented in <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.NodeEvaluator</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">Like goals, node evaluators use reference counting for
memory management. As a result, you should always use the handle objects
when dealing with node evaluators, and there is no method <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> 
to be called.</p>
<p class="p">Node evaluators use a two-step process to decide whether
one node should take precedence over another. First, the evaluator
computes a value for every node to which it is attached. This is done
by the method <samp class="ph codeph">evaluate</samp> in C++: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloNum IloCplex::NodeEvaluatorI::evaluate();</code></pre>
<p class="p">and in <strong class="ph b">Java</strong>, by the
method: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>double IloCplex.NodeEvaluator.evaluate();</code></pre>
<p class="p">and in <strong class="ph b">C#.NET</strong>:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>double Cplex.NodeEvaluator.Evaluate();</code></pre>
<p class="p">This method must be implemented by users who write their
own node evaluators. In the method <samp class="ph codeph">evaluate</samp>,
the protected methods of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::NodeEvaluatorI</samp> 
(<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.NodeEvaluator</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.NodeEvaluator</samp>)
can be called to query information about the node being evaluated.
The method <samp class="ph codeph">evaluate</samp> must compute and return
an evaluation (that is, a value) that is used later on, in the second
step, to compare two nodes and select one of them. The <samp class="ph codeph">evaluate</samp> method
is called only once for every node, and the result is cached and reused
whenever the node is compared against another node with the evaluator.</p>
<p class="p">The second step consists of comparing the current candidate
to another node. This comparison happens only for evaluators that
are shared by the current candidate and the other node. By default,
the candidate is replaced by the other node if its evaluation value
is smaller than that of the candidate. You can alter this behavior
by overwriting the method: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloBool IloCplex::NodeEvaluatorI::subsume(IloNum candVal, IloNum nodeVal);</code></pre>
<p class="p">or, in the case of <strong class="ph b">Java</strong>: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>boolean IloCplex.NodeEvaluator.subsume(double candVal, double nodeVal);</code></pre>
<p class="p">or, in the case of <strong class="ph b">C#.NET</strong>:
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>bool Cplex.NodeEvaluator.Subsume(double evalNode, double evalCurrent);</code></pre>
<p class="p">CPLEX calls this method of an evaluator attached to the
current candidate if the node being compared also has the same evaluator
attached. The first argument <samp class="ph codeph">candVal</samp> is
the evaluation value the evaluator has previously computed for the
current candidate, and <samp class="ph codeph">nodeVal</samp> is the evaluation
value the evaluator has previously computed for the node being tested.
If this method returns <samp class="ph codeph">IloTrue</samp> (<samp class="ph codeph">true</samp>),
the candidate is replaced. Otherwise, the method is called again with
reversed arguments. If it still returns <samp class="ph codeph">IloFalse</samp> (<samp class="ph codeph">false</samp>),
both nodes are tied with respect to that evaluator, and the next evaluator
they share is consulted. Otherwise, the current candidate is kept
and tested against the next node.</p>
<p class="p">There are two more virtual methods defined for node evaluators
that should be considered when you implement your own node evaluator.
The method <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp> is called immediately before <samp class="ph codeph">evaluate</samp> is
called for the first time, thus allowing you to initialize internal
data of the evaluator. When this happens, the evaluator has been initialized
to the first node to be evaluated; thus information about this node
can be queried by the methods of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::NodeEvaluatorI</samp> (<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.NodeEvaluator</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.NodeEvaluator</samp>).</p>
<p class="p">Finally, in C++, the method: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloCplex::NodeEvaluatorI* IloCplex::NodeEvaluatorI::duplicateEvaluator();</code></pre>
<p class="p">must be implemented by the user to return a copy of the
invoking node evaluator object. This method is called by <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> to
create copies of the evaluator for parallel branch &amp; cut
search.</p>
