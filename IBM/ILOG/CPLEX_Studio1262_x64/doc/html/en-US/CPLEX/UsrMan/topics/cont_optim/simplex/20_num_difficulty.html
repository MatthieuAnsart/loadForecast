<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Documents CPLEX behavior with respect to numeric difficulties
in LP models.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX is designed to handle the numeric difficulties of linear
programming automatically. In this context, numeric difficulties mean
such phenomena as:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">repeated occurrence of singularities; </p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">little or no progress toward reaching the optimal objective
function value; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">little or no progress in scaled infeasibility; </p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">repeated problem perturbations; and</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">repeated occurrences of the solution becoming infeasible. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">While CPLEX will usually achieve an optimal solution in spite of
these difficulties, you can help it do so more efficiently. This section
characterizes situations in which you can help.</p>
<p class="p">Some problems will not be solvable even after you take the measures
suggested here. For example, problems can be so poorly conditioned
that their optimal solutions are beyond the numeric precision of your
computer.</p>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.638490__User_manual.uss_solveLP.675119"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Numerical emphasis
settings</h2><p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/NumericalEmphasis.html" title="Emphasizes precision in numerically unstable or difficult problems.">numerical precision emphasis</a> parameter
controls the degree of numerical caution used during optimization
of a model. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">C++ Name NumericalEmphasis</samp> in Concert Technology</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">C Name CPX_PARAM_NUMERICALEMPHASIS</samp> in the

</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">At its default setting, CPLEX employs ordinary caution in
dealing with the numerical properties of the computations it must
perform. Under the optional setting, CPLEX uses extreme caution.</p>
<p class="p">This
emphasis parameter is different in style from the various tolerance
parameters in CPLEX. The purpose of the emphasis parameter is to relieve
the user of the need to analyze which tolerances or other algorithmic
controls to try. Instead, the user tells CPLEX that the model about
to be solved is known to be susceptible to unstable numerical behavior
and lets CPLEX make the decisions about how best to proceed.</p>
<p class="p">There
may be a trade-off between solution speed and numerical caution. You
should not be surprised if your model solves less rapidly at the optional
setting of this parameter, because each iteration may potentially
be noticeably slower than at the default. On the other hand, if the
numerical difficulty has been causing the optimizer to proceed less
directly to the optimal solution, it is possible that the optional
setting will reduce the number of iterations, thus leading to faster
solution. When the user chooses an emphasis on extreme numerical caution,
solution speed is in effect treated as no longer the primary emphasis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.638490__User_manual.uss_solveLP.655471"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Numerically sensitive
data</h2><p class="p">There is no absolute link
between the form of data in a model and the numeric difficulty the
problem poses. Nevertheless, certain choices in how you present the
data to CPLEX can have an adverse effect.</p>
<p class="p">Placing large upper
bounds (say, in the neighborhood of <em class="ph i">1e9</em> to <em class="ph i">1e12</em>) on
individual variables can cause difficulty during Presolve. If you
intend for such large bounds to mean “no bound is really in effect”
it is better to simply not include such bounds in the first place. </p>
<p class="p">Large
coefficients anywhere in the model can likewise cause trouble at various
points in the solution process. Even if the coefficients are of more
modest size, a wide variation (say, six or more orders of magnitude)
in coefficients found in the objective function or right hand side,
or in any given row or column of the matrix, can cause difficulty
either in Presolve when it makes substitutions, or in the optimizer
routines, particularly the barrier optimizer, as convergence is approached.</p>
<p class="p">A
related source of difficulty is the form of rounding when fractions
are represented as decimals; expressing 1/3 as .33333333 on a computer
that in principle computes values to about 16 digits can introduce
an apparent “exact” value that will be treated as given but may not
represent what you intend. This difficulty is compounded if similar
or related values are represented a little differently elsewhere in
the model. </p>
<p class="p">For example, consider the constraint <samp class="ph codeph">1/3
x1 + 2/3 x2 = 1</samp>. In perfect arithmetic, it is equivalent
to <samp class="ph codeph">x1 + 2 x2 = 3</samp>. However, if you express the fractional
form with decimal data values, some truncation is unavoidable. If
you happen to include the truncated decimal form of the constraint
in the same model with some differently-truncated form or even the
exact-integer data form, an unexpected result could easily occur.
Consider the following problem formulation:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Maximize
 obj: x1 + x2
Subject To
 c1: 0.333333 x1 + 0.666667 x2  = 1
 c2: x1 + 2 x2  = 3
End</code></pre>
<p class="p">With default numeric tolerances, this will deliver
an optimal solution of <samp class="ph codeph">x1=1.0</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">x2=1.0</samp> ,
giving an objective function value of <samp class="ph codeph">2.0</samp> . Now,
see what happens when using slightly more accurate data (in terms
of the fractional values that are clearly intended to be expressed):</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Maximize
 obj: x1 + x2
Subject To
 c1: 0.333333333 x1 + 0.666666667 x2  = 1
 c2: x1 + 2 x2  = 3
End</code></pre>
<p class="p">The solution to this problem has <samp class="ph codeph">x1=3.0</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">x2=0.0</samp>,
giving an optimal objective function value of <samp class="ph codeph">3.0</samp> ,
a result qualitatively different from that of the first model. Since
this latter result is the same as would be obtained by removing constraint <samp class="ph codeph">c1</samp> from
the model entirely, this is a more satisfactory result. Moreover,
the numeric stability of the optimal basis (as indicated by the condition
number, discussed in the next section), is vastly improved. </p>
<p class="p">The
result of the extra precision of the input data is a model that is
less likely to be sensitive to rounding error or other effects of
solving problems on finite-precision computers, or in extreme cases
will be more likely to produce an answer in keeping with the intended
model. The first example, above, is an instance where the data truncation
has fundamentally distorted the problem being solved. Even if the
exact-integer data form of the constraint is not present with the
decimal form, the truncated decimal form no longer exactly represents
the intended meaning and, in conjunction with other constraints in
your model, could give unintended answers that are "accurate" in the
context of the specific data being fed to the optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">Be
particularly wary of data in your model that has been computed (within
your program, or transmitted to your program from another via an input
file) using single-precision (32-bit) arithmetic. For example, in
C, this situation would arise from using type <samp class="ph codeph">float</samp> instead
of <samp class="ph codeph">double</samp>. Such data will be accurate only to about
8 decimal digits, so that (for example) if you print the data, you
might see values like <samp class="ph codeph">0.3333333432674408</samp> instead
of <samp class="ph codeph">0.3333333333333333</samp>. CPLEX uses double-precision
(64-bit) arithmetic in its computations, and truncated single-precision
data carries the risk that it will convey a different meaning than
the user intends.</p>
<p class="p">The underlying principle behind all the cautions
in this section is that information contained in the data needs to
reflect actual meaning or the optimizer may reach unstable solutions
or encounter algorithmic difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.638490__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638613"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Measuring problem
sensitivity with basis condition number kappa</h2>   <p class="p">Ill-conditioned matrices are sensitive
to minute changes in problem data. That is, in such problems, small
changes in data can lead to very large changes in the reported problem
solution. CPLEX provides a basis condition number to measure the sensitivity
of a linear system to the problem data. You might also think of the
basis condition number as the number of places in precision that can
be lost. </p>
<p class="p">For example, if the basis condition number at optimality
is <samp class="ph codeph">1e+13</samp>, then a change in a single matrix coefficient
in the thirteenth place (counting from the right) may dramatically
alter the solution. Furthermore, since many computers provide about
16 places of accuracy in double precision, only three accurate places
are left in such a solution. Even if an answer is obtained, perhaps
only the first three significant digits are reliable.</p>
<p class="p">Specifically,
condition numbers on the order of <samp class="ph codeph">1e+7</samp> indicate virtually
no chance of ill conditioning. Condition numbers on the order of <samp class="ph codeph">1e+8</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">1e+9</samp> indicate
only a slight chance of ill conditioning, and only if the model is
also poorly scaled or has some other numerical problems.  Condition
numbers on the order of <samp class="ph codeph">1e+10</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">1e+13</samp> have
some potential for ill conditioning.  Nonetheless, because the condition
number provides an upper bound on the sensitivity to change, CPLEX
usually solves models with condition numbers in this range with little
or no trouble. However, when the order of magnitude of the condition
number exceeds <samp class="ph codeph">1e+13</samp>, numerical problems are more
likely to occur.  </p>
<p class="p">More generally, for a given order of magnitude
for the feasibility and optimality tolerances, dividing the feasibility
tolerance by the machine precision specifies the lower threshold for
the condition number at which point the potential for numerical difficulties
begins.  For example,  with the default feasibility of CPLEX and optimality
tolerances of <samp class="ph codeph">1e-6</samp> and machine precision of <samp class="ph codeph">1e-16</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">1e+10</samp> is
the smallest  condition number for which algorithmic decisions might
be made based on round-off error.  This calculation explains why,
with default parameter settings, condition numbers of <samp class="ph codeph">1e+10</samp> define
the lower threshold at which point ill conditioning may occur.</p>
<p class="p">Because
of this effective loss of precision for matrices with high basis condition
numbers, CPLEX may be unable to select an optimal basis. In other
words, a high basis condition number can make it impossible to find
a solution. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">In the Interactive Optimizer, use the command <samp class="ph codeph">display solution kappa</samp> in
order to see the basis condition number of a resident basis matrix. </p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">In Concert Technology, use the method: </p>
 <p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::getQuality(IloCplex::Kappa)</samp> 
(C++)</p>
 <p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.getQuality(IloCplex.QualityType.Kappa)</samp>

 <p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.GetQuality(Cplex.QualityType.Kappa)</samp> 
(.NET)</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">In the Callable Library, use the routine<samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/getdblquality.html" title="The routine CPXXgetdblquality/CPXgetdblquality accesses double-valued information about the quality of the current solution of a problem.">CPXgetdblquality</a></samp> to
access the condition number in the double-precision variable <samp class="ph codeph">dvalue</samp>,
like this: </p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.638490__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638612"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Repeated singularities</h2><p class="p">Whenever
CPLEX encounters a singularity, it removes a column from the current
basis and proceeds with its work. CPLEX reports such actions to the
log file (by default) and to the screen (if you are working in the
Interactive Optimizer or if the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/SCRIND.html" title="Decides whether or not results are displayed on screen in an application of the C API.">messages to screen switch</a> <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_SCRIND</samp> is
set to <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> (one)). After it finds an optimal solution
under these conditions, CPLEX will then re-include the discarded column
to be sure that no better solution is available. If no better objective
value can be obtained, then the problem has been solved. Otherwise,
CPLEX continues its work until it reaches optimality.</p>
<p class="p">Occasionally,
new singularities occur, or the same singularities recur. CPLEX observes
a limit on the number of singularities it tolerates. The parameter <samp class="ph codeph">SingLim</samp> specifies
this limit. By default, the limit is ten. After encountering this
many singularities, CPLEX will save in memory the best factorable
basis found so far and stop its solution process. You may want to
save this basis to a file for later use.</p>
<p class="p">To save the best factorable
basis found so far in the Interactive Optimizer, use the <samp class="ph codeph">write</samp> command
with the file type <samp class="ph codeph">bas</samp>. When using the Component
Libraries, use the method <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.writeBasis</samp> or the
routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/writeprob.html" title="The routine CPXXwriteprob/CPXwriteprob writes a CPLEX problem object to a file in one of the formats in the table.">CPXwriteprob</a></samp>.</p>
<p class="p">If
CPLEX encounters repeated singularities in your problem, you may want
to try alternative scaling on the problem (rather than simply increasing
CPLEX tolerance for singularities). <a class="xref" href="17_params_simplex.html#User_manual.uss_solveLP.637848__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638148">Scaling</a> explains
how to try alternative scaling.</p>
<p class="p">If alternate scaling does not
help, another tactic to try is to increase the Markowitz tolerance.
The Markowitz tolerance controls the kinds of pivots permitted. If
you set it near its maximum value of <samp class="ph codeph">0.99999</samp> , it
may make iterations slower but more numerically stable. <a class="xref" href="20_num_difficulty.html#User_manual.uss_solveLP.638490__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638496">Inability to stay feasible</a> shows
how to change the Markowitz tolerance.</p>
<p class="p">If none of these ideas
help, you may need to alter the model of your problem. Consider removing
the offending variables manually from your model, and review the model
to find other ways to represent the functions of those variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.638490__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638494"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stalling due to
degeneracy</h2><p class="p">Highly
degenerate linear programs tend to stall optimization progress in
the primal and dual simplex optimizers. When stalling occurs with
the primal simplex optimizer, CPLEX automatically perturbs the variable
bounds; when stalling occurs with the dual simplex optimizer, CPLEX
perturbs the objective function.</p>
<p class="p">In either case, perturbation
creates a different but closely related problem. After CPLEX has solved
the perturbed problem, it removes the perturbation by resetting problem
data to their original values.</p>
<p class="p">If CPLEX automatically perturbs
your problem early in the solution process, you should consider starting
the solution process yourself with a perturbation. (Starting in this
way will save the time that would be wasted if you first allowed optimization
to stall and then let CPLEX perturb the problem automatically.) </p>
<p class="p">To
start perturbation yourself, set the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">PerInd</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> instead
of its default value of <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp> (zero). The perturbation
constant, <samp class="ph codeph">EpPer</samp>, is usually appropriate at its default
value of 1e-6, but can be set to any value 1e-8 or larger.</p>
<p class="p">If
you observe that your problem has been perturbed more than once, then
the perturbed problem may differ too greatly from your original problem.
In such a case, consider reducing the value of the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/EpPer.html" title="Sets the amount by which CPLEX perturbs the upper and lower bounds or objective coefficients on the variables when a problem is perturbed in the simplex algorithm.">perturbation constant</a> perturbation
constant (<samp class="ph codeph">EpPer</samp> in Concert Technology, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_EPPER</samp> in
the Callable Library).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_solveLP.638490__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638496"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Inability to stay
feasible</h2><p class="p">If a problem repeatedly
becomes infeasible in Phase II (that is, after CPLEX has achieved
a feasible solution), then numeric difficulties may be occurring.
It may help to increase the Markowitz tolerance in such a case. By
default, the value of the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">EpMrk</samp> is <samp class="ph codeph">0.01</samp>,
and suitable values range from <samp class="ph codeph">0.0001</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">0.99999</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">Sometimes
slow progress in Phase I (the period when CPLEX calculates the first
feasible solution) is due to similar numeric difficulties, less obvious
because feasibility is not gained and lost. In the progress reported
in the log file, an increase in the printed sum of infeasibilities
may be a symptom of this case. If so, it may be worthwhile to set
a higher Markowitz tolerance, just as in the more obvious case of
numeric difficulties in Phase II.</p>
