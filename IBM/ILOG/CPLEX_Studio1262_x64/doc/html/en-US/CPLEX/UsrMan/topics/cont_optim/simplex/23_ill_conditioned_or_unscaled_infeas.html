<title>Coping with an ill-conditioned problem or handling unscaled infeasibilities</title>

<h1 class="title topictitle1">Coping with an ill-conditioned problem or handling unscaled infeasibilities</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the effect of scaling on infeasible LP models.</p>
<p class="p">By default, CPLEX scales a problem before attempting
to solve it. After it finds an optimal solution, it then checks for
any violations of optimality or feasibility in the original, unscaled
problem. If there is a violation of reduced cost (indicating nonoptimality)
or of a bound (indicating infeasibility), CPLEX reports both the maximum
scaled and unscaled feasibility violations.</p>
<p class="p">Unscaled infeasibilities are rare, but they may occur
when a problem is ill-conditioned. For example, a problem containing
a row in which the coefficients have vastly different magnitude is
ill-conditioned in this sense and may result in unscaled infeasibilities.</p>
<p class="p">It may be possible to produce a better solution anyway
in spite of unscaled infeasibilities, or it may be necessary for you
to revise the coefficients. To decide which way to go, consider these
steps in such a case:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">Use the command <samp class="ph codeph">display solution quality</samp> in
the Interactive Optimizer to locate the infeasibilities.</p>

<p class="p">This command will provide the magnitude of the unscaled
infeasibilities.  If the unscaled infeasibilities just barely exceed
the CPLEX feasibility tolerance, the solution may be acceptable. 
Or, by reducing the feasibility tolerance and continuing the optimization,
you may be able to reduce the unscaled infeasibilities to an acceptable
level.  To examine solution quality from an application, use the routine <span class="keyword apiname">CPXgetdblquality</span> or
the methods <span class="keyword apiname">IloCplex::getQuality</span>, <span class="keyword apiname">IloCplex.getQuality</span>, <span class="keyword apiname">Cplex.GetQuality</span>.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Examine the coefficient matrix for poorly
scaled rows and columns.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Evaluate whether you can change unnecessarily
large or small coefficients.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Consider alternate scalings.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Consider the parameter settings.</p>

<p class="p">Consider setting the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/ScaInd.html" title="Decides how to scale the problem matrix.">scale parameter</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_SCAIND</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">ScaInd</samp>)
to 1 (one), or consider setting the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/EpMrk.html" title="Influences pivot selection during basis factoring.">Markowitz tolerance</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_EPMRK</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">EpMrk</samp>)
to .90.</p>

<p class="p">Alternatively, consider turning on the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/NumericalEmphasis.html" title="Emphasizes precision in numerically unstable or difficult problems.">numerical precision emphasis</a>(<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_NUMERICALEMPHASIS</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">NumericalEmphasis</samp>).</p>

<p class="p">Any of these nondefault parameter settings can improve
the accuracy of computed solutions on poorly scaled or ill-conditioned
models. While these settings may increase the time per iteration and
thus slow down performance, in many cases a corresponding reduction
in iteration count due to the more precise calculations compensates
for any potential increase in runtime.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">You may also be able to re-optimize the problem successfully
after you reduce optimality tolerance, as explained in <a class="xref" href="24_soln_quality.html#User_manual.uss_solveLP.640018__User_manual.uss_solveLP.639306">Maximum reduced-cost infeasibility</a>,
or after you reduce feasibility tolerance, as explained in <a class="xref" href="24_soln_quality.html#User_manual.uss_solveLP.640018__User_manual.uss_solveLP.639289">Maximum bound infeasibility: identifying largest bound violation</a>.
When you change these tolerances, CPLEX may produce a better solution
to your problem, but lowering these tolerances sometimes produces
erratic behavior or an unstable optimal basis.</p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> <p class="p">If you restart CPLEX from a previously optimal or infeasible
solution and use reduced tolerance without making any other change
to the problem, the previous solution status remains valid. Consequently,
no iterations will occur because parameter settings (such as this
reduced tolerance) are part of the environment in which CPLEX operates,
rather than part of a solution to one of possibly multiple models
in that environment. In other words, changing parameters does not
alter the solution status, but changing the model does. You can make
CPLEX restart the optimization using new tolerances by making a superfluous
change in the model, for example, by resetting the bound on a variable
to its existing value.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Check the basis condition number, as explained in <a class="xref" href="20_num_difficulty.html#User_manual.uss_solveLP.638490__User_manual.uss_solveLP.638613">Measuring problem sensitivity with basis condition number kappa</a>.
If the condition number is fairly low (for example, as little as <samp class="ph codeph">1e5</samp> or
less), then you can be confident about the solution. If the condition
number is high, or if reducing tolerance does not help, then you must
revise the model because the current model may be too ill-conditioned
to produce a numerically reliable result.</p>
