conditioning in LP models.</p>
<p class="p"> A mathematical model is said to be <strong class="ph b">ill-conditioned</strong> when
a small change in the input results in a surprisingly large change
in the computed solution. </p>
<p class="p"> Even if you do not explicitly change the data in your
model, <strong class="ph b">finite precision</strong> computers can introduce changes in
the data for a variety of reasons. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Most numbers (for example, 1/3, 5/12) cannot be represented exactly
in finite precision.</li>
<li class="li">Different chips employ different floating point representations.</li>
<li class="li">Different compilers can use the same floating point representation
differently.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"> Consequently, an ill-conditioned linear system can yield
much different results on different machines. </p>
<p class="p"> Not all kinds of ill-conditioning are easily measured.
 However, there are conventions to measure ill-conditioning in <strong class="ph b">square
linear systems of equations</strong>.  These conventions calculate a value,
known as the condition number or kappa,  based on measurable qualities
of the solution of the square linear system. (For more information
about ill-conditioning and how it is conventionally calculated, consult
the references recommended in the topic <a class="xref" href="../../preface/biblio.html#User_manual.uss_usrcplexpreface.646639" title="Recommends further reading about related topics.">Further reading</a> in
the preface of this manual.) </p>
<p class="p"> Experts in the field say that a square linear system
is ill-conditioned if the condition number kappa is large. A square
linear system is well conditioned if the condition number kappa is
small. Whether the condition number kappa is large or small depends
on the computer, the data, and the algorithmic tolerances. In particular,
ill conditioning can occur when the round off error associated with
finite precision is large enough to influence algorithmic decisions.
In other words, the basic question about both ill-conditioning and
numerical difficulties is whether the tolerances of the optimizer
can misdirect it to make decisions about the model based on round-off
error of the computer.  Algorithmic decisions based on computer round-off
error are likely to cause inconsistent results in optimization. </p>
