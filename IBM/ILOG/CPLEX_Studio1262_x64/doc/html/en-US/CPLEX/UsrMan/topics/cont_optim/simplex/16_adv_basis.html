<h1 class="title topictitle1">Starting from an advanced basis</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Documents effect of an advanced basis on LP optimizers.</p>
<p class="p">Another performance improvement to consider, unless you
are using the barrier optimizer, is starting from an advanced basis.
If you can start a simplex optimizer from an advanced basis, then
there is the potential for the optimizer to perform significantly
fewer iterations, particularly when your current problem is similar
to a problem that you have solved previously. Even when problems are
different, starting from an advanced basis may possibly help performance.
For example, if your current problem is composed of several smaller
problems, an optimal basis from one of the component problems may
significantly speed up solution of the other components or even of
the full problem.</p>
<p class="p">Note that if you are solving a sequence of LP models
all within one run, by entering a model, solving it, modifying the
model, and solving it again, then with default settings the advanced
basis will be used for the last of these steps automatically.</p>
<p class="p">In cases where models are solved in separate application
calls, and thus the basis will not be available in memory, you can
communicate the final basis from one run to the start of the next
by first saving the basis to a file before the end of the first run. </p>
<p class="p">To save the basis to a file:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">When you are using the Component Libraries,
use the method <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.writeBasis</samp> or the
Callable Library routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXmbasewrite</samp> ,
after the call to the optimizer.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">In the Interactive Optimizer, use the <samp class="ph codeph">write</samp> command
with the file type <samp class="ph codeph">bas</samp> , after optimization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Then to read an advanced basis from this file later:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">When you are using the Component Libraries,
use the method <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.readBasis</samp> or the routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXreadcopybase</samp> . </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">In the Interactive Optimizer, use the <samp class="ph codeph">read</samp> command
with the file type <samp class="ph codeph">bas</samp> .</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> <p class="p">A basis file, also known as a BAS file, is a formatted
text file conforming to the MPS standard. It relies on each variable
(column) and each constraint (row) having a name. If those names do
not exist, names will be created automatically and added during write
operations of a basis file. If you anticipate the need to read and
write basis files, it is a good idea to assign a name yourself to
every variable and constraint when you create your model.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Make sure that the advanced start parameter, <samp class="ph codeph">AdvInd</samp> ,
is set to either 1 (its default value) or 2, and not 0 (zero), before
calling the optimization routine that is to make use of an advanced
basis.</p>
<p class="p">The two nonzero settings for <samp class="ph codeph">AdvInd</samp> differ
in this way: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">AdvInd</samp> =1
causes preprocessing to be skipped; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">AdvInd</samp> =2
invokes preprocessing on both the problem and the advanced basis. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If you anticipate the advanced basis to be a close match
for your problem, so that relatively few iterations will be needed,
or if you are unsure, then the default setting of 1 is a good choice
because it avoids some overhead processing. If you anticipate that
the simplex optimizer will require many iterations even with the advanced
basis, or if the model is large and preprocessing typically removes
much from the model, then the setting of 2 may give you a faster solution
by giving you the advantages of preprocessing. However, in such cases,
you might also consider not using the advanced basis, by setting this
parameter to 0 instead, on the grounds that the basis may not be giving
you a helpful starting point after all.</p>
