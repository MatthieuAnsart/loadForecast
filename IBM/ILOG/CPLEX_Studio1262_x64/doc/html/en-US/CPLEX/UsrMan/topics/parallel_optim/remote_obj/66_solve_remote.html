<h1 class="title topictitle1">Solving a problem with remote objects</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Solves an example of distributed concurrent optimization of a mixed integer program.</p>
<p class="p">From the perspective of the master, the algorithm that the 
example <span class="ph filepath">parmipopt.c</span> implements looks like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
  Start the solve on all remote machines
  while ( all machines are solving )
     display progress message
     if ( best known lower and upper bounds are close enough )
        stop all machines
  stop all machines that are still running
  report the results
  </code></pre>
<p class="p">One way of implementing that algorithm is to use 
<strong class="ph b">asynchronous</strong> function calls on the remote objects. 
In contrast to a synchronous function call, an asynchronous function
call does not block until the call completes.  Instead, 
an asynchronous function returns immediately after triggering the call on the
remote object. It returns a reference to a handle that can be used to check
progress of the operation or to wait for completion of the operation.</p>
<p class="p">To start the solves on all remote objects, the example invokes the 
asynchronous version of MIP optimization, like this:</p>
<img class="image" src="../../../images/egRemoteObj_MIPoptAsync.jpg" /><p class="p">After that call, each machine will have started solving the problem with the
defined parameter settings. The argument <samp class="ph codeph">handle[i]</samp> is a handle 
to the remote function call being executed on machine i. To check whether this 
function is still running (that is, to verify that the machine is still solving 
and has not yet found the optimal solution), the example uses the following line, 
an asynchronous test:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> CPXXasynctest (handle[i], &amp;running);</code></pre>
<p class="p">If the function is still running, that test puts a true value 
in the argument <samp class="ph codeph">running</samp>; 
otherwise, the function puts a false value there. If the value of 
<samp class="ph codeph">running</samp> is false, then the function call being tested 
has solved the problem to optimality. In that case, the example stops 
all other machines and reads the optimal solution from the machine that 
found it. </p>
<p class="p">In order to stop an ongoing solve on a remote object that has 
not yet finished, the example uses an asynchronous kill, like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> CPXXasynckill (handle[j]);</code></pre>
<p class="p">That line stops the function call defined by <samp class="ph codeph">handle[j]</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">Here is the entire loop on the master:</p>
<img class="image" src="../../../images/egRemoteObj_master_loop.jpg" /><p class="p">In the first part of the loop, this example checks whether the best known lower and upper
bounds are close enough. Interestingly, the bounds may come from different 
machines. If the bounds are close enough, then the optimal solution has been found and
optimality has been proven. In that case, the example can abort the solve on all remote objects.</p>
<p class="p">In the second part of the loop, the example checks whether any remote solve has already
finished. If so, then the example stops the solve on all other machines and exits from the
loop.</p>
<p class="p">Since the loop implements a polling mechanism, the example implements a small delay
(usleep(200)) so as to not poll frantically.</p>
<p class="p">In order to clean up resources properly, the example must join all the asynchronous
solves that were triggered, regardless of whether they completed or were killed
prematurely. After the example has successfully joined the asynchronous call of 
<span class="keyword apiname">CPXXmipopt</span>, 
the results of this function call are available, and the example can query the
objective function value and algorithm status for each remote object, like this:</p>
