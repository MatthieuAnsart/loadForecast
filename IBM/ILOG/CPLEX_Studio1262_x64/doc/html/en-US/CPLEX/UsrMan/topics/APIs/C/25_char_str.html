<p class="p">You can pass character strings as parameters to various
CPLEX routines, for example, as row or column names. The Interactive
Optimizer truncates output strings 255 characters. Routines from the
Callable Library truncate strings at 255 characters in output text
files (such as MPS or LP text files) but not in <em class="ph i">binary</em> SAV files. Routines from the
Callable Library also truncate strings at 255 characters in names
that occur in messages. Routines of the Callable Library that produce
log files, such as the simplex iteration log file or the MIP node
log file, truncate at 16 characters. Input, such as names read from
LP and MPS files or typed interactively by the <samp class="ph codeph">enter</samp> command,
are truncated to 255 characters. However, it is not recommended that
you rely on this truncation because unexpected behavior may result.</p>
<p class="p">A string passed to CPLEX by your application as an argument of a Callable
Library routine must be terminated by the <samp class="ph codeph">NUL</samp>
character.  In other words, CPLEX recognizes <samp class="ph codeph">NUL</samp> as the termination 
of a string that it accepts as an argument.
This programming convention in C has implications for your choice of encoding.
If you change the encoding of CPLEX from its default encoding ISO-8859-1 (also
known as Latin-1) to a multi-byte encoding such as UTF-32, where a 
<samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> byte
can exist in the multi-byte representation of a character, then you must take
care that a 
<samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> byte within the multi-byte representation of a character does
not unintentionally terminate a string passed to CPLEX as an argument.
For an extended explanation of this point plus an example of how 
this situation can produce unintended results, see the topic
