<h1 class="title topictitle1">What is FeasOpt?</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Defines FeasOpt, defines preferences, and describes facilities
in FeasOpt.</p>
<p class="p">FeasOpt attempts to repair an infeasibility by modifying
the model according to <em class="ph i">preferences</em> set
by the user. FeasOpt accepts an infeasible model and selectively relaxes
the bounds and constraints in a way that minimizes a weighted penalty
function that you define. FeasOpt supports all types of infeasible
models, except those models with second order cone constraints. 
In fact, you can apply FeasOpt to a second order cone program (SOCP) 
as long as you do not relax the second order cones in the model.</p>
<p class="p">In
essence, FeasOpt is another optimization algorithm (analogous to phase
I of the simplex algorithm). It tries to suggest the least change
that would achieve feasibility. FeasOpt does not actually modify your
model. Instead, it suggests a set of bounds and constraint ranges
and produces the solution that would result from these relaxations.
Your application can query this solution. It can also report these
values directly, or it can apply these new values to your model, or
you can run FeasOpt again with different weights perhaps to find a
more acceptable relaxation.</p>
<p class="p">The infeasibility on which FeasOpt works must be present
explicitly in your model among its constraints and bounds. In particular,
if you have set a MIP cutoff value with the idea that the cutoff value
will render your model infeasible, and then you apply FeasOpt, you
will not achieve the effect you expect. In such a case, you should
add one or more explicit constraints to enforce the restriction you
have in mind. In other words, add constraints rather than attempt
to enforce a restriction through the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/CutLo.html" title="Sets lower cutoff tolerance.">lower cutoff</a> and <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/CutUp.html" title="Sets the upper cutoff tolerance.">upper cutoff</a> parameters:</p>
