models.</p>
<p class="p">An important feature of CPLEX is that even if no feasible
solution has been found, (that is, if <a class="xref logicalApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html#method_solve" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">solve</a> returns <samp class="ph codeph">IloFalse</samp>), some information about the problem can
be queried. All the methods discussed so far may successfully return
information about the current (infeasible) solution which CPLEX maintains. </p>
<p class="p">Unfortunately, there is no simple comprehensive rule about
whether or not current solution information can be queried because,
by default, CPLEX uses a presolve procedure to simplify the model.
If, for example, the model is proven to be infeasible during the presolve,
no current solution is generated by the optimizer. If, in contrast,
infeasibility is proven by the optimizer, current solution information
is available to be queried. The status returned by  <a class="xref logicalApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html#method_getCplexStatus" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">getCplexStatus</a> may
help you decide which case you are facing, but it is probably safer
and easier to include the methods for querying solution within try/catch
statements.</p>
<p class="p">When an LP has been proven to be infeasible, CPLEX provides
assistance for investigating the cause of the infeasibility. In one
approach, known as FeasOpt, CPLEX accepts an infeasible model and
selectively relaxes bounds and constraints to find a minimal set of
changes that would make the model feasible. It then reports these
suggested changes and the solution they would produce for you to decide
whether to apply them in your model. For more about this approach,
see <a class="xref" href="../../cont_optim/simplex/26_feasopt.html" title="Introduces FeasOpt as a tool for repairing infeasibility in LP models.">Repairing infeasibility: FeasOpt</a>. </p>
<p class="p">In another approach, CPLEX can detect a conflict among
the constraints and bounds of an infeasible model and refine the conflict
to report to you a minimal conflict to repair yourself. For more about
this approach, see <a class="xref" href="../../infeas_unbd/conflict_refiner/01_ref_confl_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes the conflict refiner, a feature for diagnosing the cause of infeasibility in a model, whether continuous or discrete, whether linear or quadratic.">Diagnosing infeasibility by refining conflicts</a>.</p>
<p class="p">For more about these and other ways of overcoming infeasibility,
see <a class="xref" href="../../cont_optim/simplex/21_infeas_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents ways to diagnose sources of infeasibility in LP models.">Diagnosing LP infeasibility</a>.</p>
