<h1 class="title topictitle1">Cuts and goals</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Distinguishes local cuts from global cuts and illustrates
cuts added by a goal</p>
<p class="p">Goals can also be used to add global cuts. Whereas local
cuts are respected only in a subtree, global cuts are added to the
entire problem and are therefore respected at every node after they
have been added.</p>
<p class="p">Just as you can add local cuts by means of a local cut
goal, as explained in the topic <a class="xref" href="11_local_cut_goal.html" title="Describes a local cut goal to add a cut to a node.">Local cut goal</a>,
you can add a global cut by means of a global cut goal. A global cut
goal is created with the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI::GlobalCutGoal</samp> 
(<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.globalCutGoal</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.GlobalCutGoal</samp> ).
This method takes an instance of <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> 
or <samp class="ph codeph">IloRangeArray</samp>  (<samp class="ph codeph">IloRange[]</samp> )
  as its argument and returns a goal. When the goal executes, it adds
the constraints as global cuts to the problem.</p>
<p class="p">Example <samp class="ph codeph">ilogoalex2.cpp</samp>  shows
the use of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI::GlobalCutGoal</samp> for
solving the <samp class="ph msgph">noswot</samp> MILP model. This
is a relatively small model from the MIPLIB 3.0 test set, consisting
of only 128 variables. Nonetheless, it used to be very hard to solve
without adding special cuts.</p>
<p class="p">Although it is now solvable directly in less than two
minutes, the number of nodes examined is still on the order of 2.5
billion, even for only 128 original variables. However, cuts can be
derived, and the addition of these cuts makes the problem solvable
in under a second with roughly 600 nodes. These cuts are: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>x21 - x22 &lt;= 0
x22 - x23 &lt;= 0
x23 - x24 &lt;= 0
2.08*x11 + 2.98*x21 + 3.47*x31 + 2.24*x41 + 2.08*x51 +
0.25*w11 + 0.25*w21 + 0.25*w31 + 0.25*w41 + 0.25*w51 &lt;= 20.25
2.08*x12 + 2.98*x22 + 3.47*x32 + 2.24*x42 + 2.08*x52 +
0.25*w12 + 0.25*w22 + 0.25*w32 + 0.25*w42 + 0.25*w52 &lt;= 20.25
2.08*x13 + 2.98*x23 + 3.47*x33 + 2.24*x43 + 2.08*x53 +
0.25*w13 + 0.25*w23 + 0.25*w33 + 0.25*w43 + 0.25*w53 &lt;= 20.25

0.25*w15 + 0.25*w25 + 0.25*w35 + 0.25*w45 + 0.25*w55 &lt;= 16.25</code></pre>
<p class="p">These cuts derive from interpreting the problem as a
resource allocation model on five machines with scheduling horizon
constraints and transaction times. The first three cuts break symmetries
among the machines, while the others capture minimum bounds on transaction
costs.</p>
<p class="p">Of course, the best way to solve the <samp class="ph msgph">noswot</samp> model
with these cuts is simply to add them to the model before calling
the optimizer. However, for demonstration purposes here, the cuts
are added by means of a goal. The source code of this example can
be found in the <samp class="ph codeph">examples/src</samp> directory
of the CPLEX distribution. The equivalent <strong class="ph b">Java</strong> implementation
appears as <samp class="ph codeph">GoalEx2.java</samp>  in the same location.
Likewise, there is also the <strong class="ph b">C#.NET</strong> version
in <samp class="ph codeph">Goalex2.cs</samp>  and the <strong class="ph b">VB.NET</strong> version
in <samp class="ph codeph">Goalex2.vb</samp> .</p>
<p class="p">The goal <samp class="ph codeph">CutGoal</samp> in that example
receives a list of "less than" constraints to use as global cuts and
a tolerance value <samp class="ph codeph">eps</samp>. The constraints
are passed to the goal as an array of <samp class="ph codeph">lhs</samp> expressions
and an array of corresponding <samp class="ph codeph">rhs</samp> values.
Both are initialized in function <samp class="ph codeph">makeCuts</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">The goal <samp class="ph codeph">CutGoal</samp> checks whether
any of the constraints passed to it are violated by more than the
tolerance value. It adds violated constraints as global cuts. Other
than that, it follows the branching strategy CPLEX would use on its
own.</p>
<p class="p">The goal starts out by checking whether the solution
of the continuous relaxation of the current node subproblem is integer
feasible. This check is done by the method <samp class="ph codeph">isIntegerFeasible</samp>.
If the current solution is integer feasible, a candidate for a new
incumbent has been found, and the goal returns the empty goal to instruct
CPLEX to continue on its own.</p>
<p class="p">Otherwise, the goal checks whether any of the constraints
passed to it are violated. It computes the value of every <samp class="ph codeph">lhs</samp> 
expression for current solution by calling <samp class="ph codeph">getValue(lhs[i])</samp>.
The result is compared to the corresponding righthand side value <samp class="ph codeph">rhs[i]</samp>.
If a violation of more than <samp class="ph codeph">eps</samp> is detected,
the constraint is added as a global cut and the <samp class="ph codeph">rhs</samp> value
will be set at <samp class="ph codeph">IloInfinity</samp> to avoid checking
it again unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="p">The global cut goal for <samp class="ph codeph">lhs[i]</samp>  ≤<samp class="ph codeph">rhs[i]</samp> is
created by the method <samp class="ph codeph">GlobalCutGoal</samp>. It
is then combined with the goal named <samp class="ph codeph">goal</samp> by
the method <samp class="ph codeph">AndGoal</samp>, so that the new global
cut goal will be executed first. The resulting goal is stored again
in <samp class="ph codeph">goal</samp>. Before any global cut goals are
added, the <samp class="ph codeph">goal</samp> is initialized as: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloCplex::Goal goal = AndGoal(BranchAsCplexGoal(getEnv()), this);</code></pre>
<p class="p">for C++, or for Java: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cplex.and(cplex.branchAsCplex(), this);</code></pre>
<p class="p">The method <samp class="ph codeph">BranchAsCplexGoal(getEnv)</samp>  <samp class="ph codeph">(cplex.branchAsCplex</samp> in
the Java API or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.BranchAsCplex</samp> in
the .NET API) creates a goal that branches in the same way as the
built-in branch procedure. By adding this goal, the current goal will
be executed for the entire subtree.</p>
<p class="p">Thus the goal returned by <samp class="ph codeph">CutGoal</samp> will
add all currently violated constraints as global cuts one by one.
Then it will branch in the way CPLEX would branch without any goals
and execute the <samp class="ph codeph">CutGoal</samp> again in the child
nodes.</p>
