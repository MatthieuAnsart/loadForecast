<title>Using arrays for input or output</title>
</head>
<body role="main" id="User_manual.uss_cplusIloCplex.123874">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">Using arrays for input or output</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes input and out in the application.</p>
<p class="p">If all goes well, the input file is opened in the file <samp class="ph codeph">ifstream</samp> .
After that, the arrays for storing the problem data are created by
declaring the appropriate variables. Then the arrays are filled by
using the input operator with the data file. The data is checked for
consistency and, if it fails, the program is aborted, again by throwing
an exception. </p>
<p class="p">After the problem data has been read and verified, it
is time to build the model. To do so, construct the model object with
this declaration: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloModel mod(env);</code></pre>
<p class="p"> The array <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp>  is created
to store the modeling variables. Since the environment is not passed
to the constructor of <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp> , an empty handle
is constructed. So at this point the variable <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp> 
cannot be used. </p>
<p class="p">Depending on the command-line option, either <samp class="ph codeph">buildMethodByRow</samp> 
or <samp class="ph codeph">buildMethodByColumn</samp>  is called. Both
create the model of the diet problem from the input data and return
an array of modeling variables as an instance of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVarArray</samp> .
At that point, <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp>  is assigned to an initialized
handle containing all the modeling variables and can be used afterwards. </p>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_cplusIloCplex.123874__User_manual.uss_cplusIloCplex.123892"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Building the model by row</h2><p class="p">The model is created by rows using the function <samp class="ph codeph">buildModelByRow</samp> .
It first gets the environment from the model object passed to it.
Then the modeling variables <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp>  are created.
Instead of calling the constructor for the variables individually
for each variable, create the full array of variables, with the array
of lower and upper bounds and the variable type as parameter. In this
array, variable <samp class="ph codeph">Buy[i]</samp>  is created such
that it has lower bound <samp class="ph codeph">foodMin[i]</samp> , upper
bound <samp class="ph codeph">foodMax[i]</samp> , and type indicated by <samp class="ph codeph">type</samp> . </p>
<p class="p">The statement: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>mod.add(IloMinimize(env, IloScalProd(Buy, foodCost)));</code></pre>
<p class="p">creates the objective function and adds it to the model.
The <samp class="ph codeph">IloScalProd</samp>  function creates the expression <samp class="ph codeph">∑j
(Buy[j] * foodCost[j])</samp>  which is then passed to the
function <samp class="ph codeph">IloMinimize</samp> . That function creates
and returns the actual <samp class="ph codeph">IloObjective</samp>  object,
which is added to the model with the call <samp class="ph codeph">mod.add</samp> . </p>
<p class="p">The following loop creates the constraints of the problem
one by one and adds them to the model. First the expression <samp class="ph codeph">∑j
(Buy[j] * nutrPer[i][j])</samp>  is created by building a Concert
Technology expression. An expression variable <samp class="ph codeph">expr</samp> 
of type <samp class="ph codeph">IloExpr</samp>  is created, and linear
terms are added to it by using <samp class="ph codeph">operator+=</samp> 
in a loop. The expression is used with the overloaded <samp class="ph codeph">operator&lt;=</samp> 
to construct a range constraint (an <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> 
object) which is added to the model: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>mod.add(nutrMin[i] &lt;= expr &lt;= nutrMax[i]);</code></pre>
<p class="p">After an expression has been used for creating a constraint,
it is deleted by a call to <samp class="ph codeph">expr.end</samp> .</p>
<p class="p">Finally, the array of modeling variables <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp> 
is returned. </p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_cplusIloCplex.123874__User_manual.uss_cplusIloCplex.123912"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Building the model by column</h2><p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">buildModelByColumn </samp> implements
the creation of the model by columns. It begins by creating the array
of modeling variables <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp>  of size 0. This
is later populated when the columns of the problem are created and
eventually returned. </p>
<p class="p">The statement:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloObjective cost = IloAdd(mod, IloMinimize(env));</code></pre>
<p class="p"> creates a minimization objective function object with
0 expressions and adds it to the model. The objective object is created
with the function <samp class="ph codeph">IloMinimize</samp> . The template
function <samp class="ph codeph">IloAdd</samp>  is used to add the objective
as an object to the model and to return an objective object with the
same type, so that the objective can be stored in the variable <samp class="ph codeph">cost</samp> .
The method <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel::add</samp>  returns the modeling
object as an <samp class="ph codeph">IloExtractable</samp> , which cannot
be assigned to a variable of a derived class such as <samp class="ph codeph">IloObjective</samp> .
Similarly, an array of range constraints with 0 (zero) expressions
is created, added to the model, and stored in the array <samp class="ph codeph">range</samp> . </p>
<p class="p">In the following loop, the variables of the model are
created one by one in columns; thus, the new variables are immediately
installed in the model. An <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumColumn</samp> 
object <samp class="ph codeph">col</samp>  is created and initialized
to define how each new variable will be appended to the existing objective
and constraints.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumColumn</samp>  object <samp class="ph codeph">col</samp> 
is initialized to contain the objective coefficient for the new variable.
This is created with <samp class="ph codeph">cost(foodCost[j])</samp> ,
that is using the overloaded <samp class="ph codeph">operator()</samp> 
for <samp class="ph codeph">IloObjective</samp> . Next, an <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumColumn</samp> 
object is created for every constraint, representing the coefficient
the new variable has in that constraint. Again these <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumColumn</samp> 
objects are created with the overloaded <samp class="ph codeph">operator()</samp> ,
this time of <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange</samp> . The <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumColumn</samp> 
objects are merged together to an aggregate <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumColumn</samp> 
object using operator <samp class="ph codeph">+=</samp> . The coefficient
for row <samp class="ph codeph">i</samp>  is created with <samp class="ph codeph">range[i](nutrPer[i][j])</samp> ,
which calls the overloaded <samp class="ph codeph">operator()</samp> 
for <samp class="ph codeph">IloRange </samp> objects. </p>
<p class="p">When a column is completely constructed, a new variable
is created for it and added to the array of modeling variables <samp class="ph codeph">Buy</samp> .
The construction of the variable is performed by the constructor: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloNumVar(col, foodMin[j], foodMax[j], type)</code></pre>
<p class="p">which creates the new variable with lower bound <samp class="ph codeph">foodMin[j]</samp> ,
upper bound <samp class="ph codeph">foodMax[j]</samp>  and type <samp class="ph codeph">type</samp> ,
and adds it to the existing objective and ranges with the coefficients
specified in column <samp class="ph codeph">col</samp> . After creating
the variable for this column, the <samp class="ph codeph">IloColumn</samp> 
object is deleted by calling <samp class="ph codeph">col.end</samp> .</p>
