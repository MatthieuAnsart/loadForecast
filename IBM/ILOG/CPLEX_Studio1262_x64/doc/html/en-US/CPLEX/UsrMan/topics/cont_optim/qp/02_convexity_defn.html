<h1 class="title topictitle1">Distinguishing between convex and nonconvex QPs</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains how to determine the convexity of a quadratic program.</p>
<p class="p">Conventionally, a quadratic program (QP) is formulated
this way:</p>
<p class="p">Minimize    1/2 x<sup class="ph sup">T</sup>Qx + c<sup class="ph sup">T</sup>x</p>
<p class="p">subject to   Ax ~ b</p>
<p class="p">with these bounds l <samp class="ph codeph">≤</samp> x <samp class="ph codeph">≤</samp> u</p>
<p class="p">where the relation ~ may be any combination of equal
to, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, or range constraints.
As in other problem formulations, l indicates lower and u upper bounds.
Q is a matrix of objective function coefficients. That is, the elements
Q<sub class="ph sub">jj</sub> are the coefficients of the
quadratic terms x<sub class="ph sub">j</sub><sup class="ph sup">2</sup>,
and the elements Q<sub class="ph sub">ij</sub> and Q<sub class="ph sub">ji</sub> are
summed together to be the coefficient of the term x<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>x<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>. </p>
<p class="p">IBM ILOG
CPLEX distinguishes between two kinds of Q matrices: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">In a <em class="ph i">separable</em> problem,
only the diagonal terms of the matrix are defined; all off-diagonal
terms of the matrix are zero.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">In a <em class="ph i">nonseparable</em> problem,
at least one off-diagonal term of the matrix is nonzero.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">CPLEX can solve minimization problems having a convex
quadratic objective function. Equivalently, it can solve maximization
problems having a concave quadratic objective function. All linear
objective functions satisfy this property for both minimization and
maximization. However, you cannot always assume this property in the
case of a quadratic objective function. </p>
<p class="p">CPLEX can also compute points that satisfy <em class="ph i">first-order optimality conditions</em> of
models with arbitrary quadratic objective functions.  These models
include minimization problems with a concave objective function, maximization
problems with a convex objective function, and either minimization
or maximization problems with objective functions that are neither
convex nor concave.  Such points may not be the globally optimal solution
to the model.</p>
<p class="p">Intuitively, recall that any point on the line between
two arbitrary points of a convex function will be above that function.
In more formal terms, a continuous segment (that is, a straight line)
connecting two arbitrary points on the graph of the objective function
will not go below the objective of a minimization problem, and equivalently,
the straight line will not go above the objective of a maximization
problem. The image <a class="xref" href="02_convexity_defn.html#User_manual.uss_solveQP.636168__User_manual.uss_solveQP.645373">Figure 1</a> illustrates
this intuitive idea for an objective function in one variable. It
is possible for a quadratic function in more than one variable to
be neither convex nor concave.</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="User_manual.uss_solveQP.636168__User_manual.uss_solveQP.645373"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Minimize a convex objective function, maximize a concave
objective function</span><div class="image"><img class="image" src="../../../images/solveQPn.gif" alt="solveQPn.gif" /></div></div>
<p class="p">In formal terms, the question of whether a quadratic
objective function is convex or concave is equivalent to whether the
matrix Q is positive semi-definite or negative semi-definite. For
convex QPs, Q must be positive semi-definite; that is, x<sup class="ph sup">T</sup>Qx <samp class="ph codeph">≥</samp> 0
for every vector x, whether or not x is feasible. For concave maximization
problems, the requirement is that Q must be negative semi-definite;
that is, x<sup class="ph sup">T</sup>Qx <samp class="ph codeph">≤</samp> 0
for every vector x. It is conventional to use the same term, positive
semi-definite, abbreviated PSD, for both cases, on the assumption
that a maximization problem with a negative semi-definite Q can be
transformed into an equivalent PSD.</p>
<p class="p">For a separable function, to determine the convexity of a problem, 
it is sufficient to check whether
the individual diagonal elements of the matrix Q are of the correct
sign. For the nonseparable case, it may be less easy to decide in advance
the convexity of Q. However, CPLEX detects this property during the
early stages of optimization.</p>
<p class="p">By default, CPLEX terminates if the quadratic objective
term in a QP is found to be non PSD. In such a case, in order to instruct 
CPLEX not to terminate, you must set the 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/OptimalityTarget.html" title="Specifies type of optimality that CPLEX targets (optimal convex or first-order satisfaction) as it searches for a solution">optimality target</a> parameter.
The value that you set for that parameter depends on the type of results that you expect.
If you would like CPLEX to compute a point that satisfies <strong class="ph b">first-order 
optimality conditions</strong> (that is, a local optimum), then you set the parameter to 
the value  <span class="keyword apiname">CPX_SOLUTIONTARGET_FIRSTORDER</span>.
If you would like CPLEX to find a <strong class="ph b">global optimum</strong>, then you set the parameter to 
the value  <span class="keyword apiname">CPX_SOLUTIONTARGET_OPTIMALGLOBAL</span>.</p>

generally, a textbook, such as one of those listed in <a class="xref" href="../../preface/biblio.html" title="Recommends further reading about related topics.">Further reading</a> of
the preface of this manual, may be helpful.</p>
