<h1 class="title topictitle1">Overview</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Offers an overview of the architecture.</p>
<p class="p">A user-written application of IBM ILOG CPLEX in Java first
creates an <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> object. It then uses
the Concert Technology modeling interface implemented by <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> to
create the variables, the constraints, and the objective function
of the model to be solved. For example, every variable in a model
is represented by an object that implements the Concert Technology
variable interface <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar</samp>. The user
code accesses the variable only through its Concert Technology interface.
Similarly, all other modeling objects are accessed only through their
respective Concert Technology interfaces from the user-written application,
while the actual objects are maintained in the CPLEX database.</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="03_archi_overview.html#mEFpa14Y__User_manual.uss_javaIloCplex.1027894">Figure 1</a> illustrates how
an application uses Concert Technology, <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp>,
and the CPLEX internals. The Java interfaces, represented by the dashed
outline, do not actually consume memory. The CPLEX internals include
the computing environment, its communication channels, and your problem
objects.</p>
<p class="p">A user-written Java application and CPLEX internals use
separate memory heaps. Java supports two different command-line options
of interest in this respect:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">-Xms</samp> sets
the initial heap size for the Java-part of the application;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">-Xmx</samp> sets
the maximum heap size for the Java part of the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For applications where more memory is needed, you must
carefully assess whether the Java application needs to increase or
decrease its memory heap. In some cases, the Java application needs
more memory to create the model to be solved. If so, use the <samp class="ph codeph">-Xmx</samp> option
to increase the maximum heap size. Keep in mind that allocating more
space in the heap to the Java application makes less memory available
to the CPLEX internals, so increase the maximum heap size only as
needed. Otherwise, the Java application will use too much memory,
imposing an unnecessary limitation on the memory available to the
CPLEX internals.</p>
<p class="p">In cases where insufficient memory is available for CPLEX
internals, there are remedies to consider with respect to the heap:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">make sure the maximum heap size has
not been set to a value larger than needed;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">consider reducing the default maximum
heap size if the Java application can operate with less memory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For users familiar with object-oriented design patterns,
this design is that of a factory, where <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> is
a factory for modeling objects. The advantage of such a design is
that code which creates a model using the Concert Technology modeling
interface can be used not only with <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex,</samp> but
also with any other factory class, for instance <samp class="ph codeph">IloSolver</samp>.
This allows you to try different optimization technologies for solving
your model.</p>
