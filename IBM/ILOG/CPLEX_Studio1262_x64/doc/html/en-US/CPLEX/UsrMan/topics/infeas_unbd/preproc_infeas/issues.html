<p class="p">The topics discussed in <a class="xref" href="../../cont_optim/part_cont_optim_title_synopsis.html" title="This part focuses on algorithmic considerations about the optimizers of IBM ILOG CPLEX that solve problems formulated in terms of continuous variables. While ILOG CPLEX is delivered with default settings that enable you to solve many problems without changing parameters, this part also documents features that you can customize for your application.">Continuous optimization</a> and <a class="xref" href="../../discr_optim/part_discr_optim_title_synopsis.html" title="This part focuses on algorithmic considerations about the optimizers of IBM ILOG CPLEX that solve problems formulated in terms of discrete variables, such as integer, Boolean, piecewise-linear, or semi-continuous variables. While default settings of ILOG CPLEX enable you to solve many problems without changing parameters, this part also documents features that enable you to tune performance.">Discrete optimization</a> often contained the implicit assumption that
a bounded feasible solution to your model actually exists. Such may
not always be the case.</p>
<p class="p">The following topics discuss steps to try when the outcome
of an optimization is a declaration that your model is either:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">infeasible</strong>; that is, no solution exists that satisfies all the constraints,
bounds, and integrality restrictions; <strong class="ph b">or</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">unbounded</strong>; that is, the objective function can be made arbitrarily large.</p>

<p class="p">(A more careful definition of unbounded is provided in <a class="xref" href="../unbounded/02_unbnded_defn.html" title="Defines unboundedness and tells how to access further information about the problem.">What is unboundedness?</a>.) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Infeasibility and unboundedness are closely related topics
in optimization theory. Consequently, certain of the concepts for
one will have direct relation to the other. As you know, IBM ILOG CPLEX can provide you
solution information about the models that it optimizes. For infeasible
outcomes, it reports values that you can analyze to detect what in
your problem formulation caused this result. In certain situations,
you can then alter your problem formulation or change CPLEX parameters
to achieve a satisfactory solution. </p>
<p class="p">Infeasibility can arise from various causes, and it is
not possible to automate procedures to deal with those causes entirely
without input or intervention from the user. For example, in a shipment
model, infeasibility could be caused by insufficient supply, or by
an error in demand, and it is likely that the optimizer will tell
the user only that the mismatch exists. The formulator of the model
has to make the ultimate judgment of what the actual error is. </p>
<p class="p">However, there are ways for you to try to narrow down
the investigation with help from CPLEX, for example, through tools
such as the conflict refiner, documented in <a class="xref" href="../conflict_refiner/01_ref_confl_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes the conflict refiner, a feature for diagnosing the cause of infeasibility in a model, whether continuous or discrete, whether linear or quadratic.">Diagnosing infeasibility by refining conflicts</a>. In certain situations, CPLEX even provides
some degree of automatic repair, for example, with tools such as FeasOpt,
documented in <a class="xref" href="../feasopt/01_feasopt_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents FeasOpt, a feature for repairing infeasibility in a model.">Repairing infeasibilities with FeasOpt</a>.</p>
<p class="p">The following topic explains how to interpret reports
of infeasibility that occur before optimization begins, that is, reports
that arise from preprocessing.</p>
