<h1 class="title topictitle1">How a conflict differs from an IIS</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Distinguishes a conflict from an irreducibly inconsistent
set (IIS).</p>
<p class="p">In some ways a conflict resembles an irreducibly inconsistent
set (IIS). Detection of an IIS among the constraints of a model is
a standard methodology in the published literature; an IIS finder
has long been available as a tool within CPLEX. Both tools (conflict
refiner and IIS finder) attempt to identify an infeasible subproblem
of a provably infeasible model. </p>
<p class="p">However, a conflict is more general than an IIS. The
IIS finder is applicable only to continuous LP models, (including
 those obtained from a continuous QP by removing the quadratic objective
terms).   In contrast, the conflict refiner is  capable of doing its
work on all continuous and discrete problem types that CPLEX supports,
except for those with explicit second order cone constraints.</p>
<p class="p">Also, you can specify one or more <em class="ph i">groups</em> of constraints for a conflict;
a group will either be present together in the conflict, or else will
not be part of it at all. </p>
<p class="p">You can also assign numeric <em class="ph i">preference</em> to
a constraint or to groups of constraints. In the case of an infeasible
model that has more than one possible conflict, the preferences you
assign will guide the tool toward detecting the conflict you want.
Preferences allow you to specify aspects of the model that may otherwise
be difficult to encode.</p>
<p class="p">While the conflict refiner usually will deliver a smaller
set of constraints to consider than the IIS finder will, the methods
are different enough that the reverse can sometimes be true. The fact
that the IIS finder implements a standard methodology may weigh toward
its use in some situations. Otherwise, the conflict refiner can be
thought of as usually doing everything the IIS finder can, and often
more. In fact, you might think of the conflict refiner as an extension
and generalization of the IIS finder.</p>
