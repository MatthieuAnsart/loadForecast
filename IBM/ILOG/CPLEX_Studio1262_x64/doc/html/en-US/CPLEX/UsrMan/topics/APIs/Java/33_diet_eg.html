<h1 class="title topictitle1">Example: optimizing the diet problem in Java</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes an application to solve the diet problem in
the Java API.</p>
<p class="p">The problem solved in this example is to minimize the
cost of a diet that satisfies certain nutritional constraints. You
might also want to compare this approach through the Java API of CPLEX
with similar applications in other programming languages:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> <a class="xref" href="../Cpp/eg_diet_synopsis.html" title="Shows an example of the C++ API.">Example: optimizing the diet problem in C++</a> </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <a class="xref" href="../dotNET/27_diet_eg_location.html" title="Tells where to find complete application, project, lessons for the tutorial.">Example: optimizing the diet problem in C#.NET</a> </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <a class="xref" href="../C/32_diet_eg_title_synopsis.html" title="Walks through an example applying the C API.">Example: optimizing the diet problem in the Callable Library</a> </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">This example was chosen because it is simple enough to
be viewed from a row as well as from a column perspective. Both ways
are shown in the example. In this example, either perspective can
be viewed as natural. Only one approach will seem natural for many
models, but there is no general way of deciding which is more appropriate
(rows or columns) in a particular case.</p>
<p class="p">The example accepts a filename and two options <samp class="ph codeph">-c</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">-i</samp> as
command line arguments. Option <samp class="ph codeph">-i</samp> allows
you to create a MIP model where the quantities of foods to purchase
must be integers. Option <samp class="ph codeph">-c</samp> can be used
to build the model by columns.</p>
<p class="p">The example starts by evaluating the command line arguments
and reading the input data file. The input data of the diet problem
is read from a file using an object of the embedded class <samp class="ph codeph">Diet.Data</samp>.
Its constructor requires a file name as an argument. Using the class <samp class="ph codeph">InputDataReader</samp>,
it reads the data from that file. This class is distributed with the
examples, but will not be considered here as it does not use CPLEX
or Concert Technology in any special way.</p>
<p class="p">After the data has been read, the <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> modeler/optimizer
is created. </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloCplex     cplex = new IloCplex();
IloNumVar[]  Buy   = new IloNumVar[nFoods];

if ( byColumn ) buildModelByColumn(cplex, data, Buy, varType);
   else buildModelByRow (cplex, data, Buy, varType);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The array <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVar[] Buy</samp> is
also created where the modeling variables will be stored by <samp class="ph codeph">buildModelByRow</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">buildModelByColumn</samp> .</p>
<p class="p">You have already seen a method very similar to <samp class="ph codeph">buildModelByRow</samp>.
This function is called when <samp class="ph codeph">byColumn</samp> is
false, which is the case when the example is executed without the <samp class="ph codeph">-c</samp> command
line option; otherwise, <samp class="ph codeph">buildModelByColumn</samp> is
called. Note that unlike <samp class="ph codeph">buildModelByRow</samp>,
this method requires <samp class="ph codeph">IloMPModeler</samp> rather
than <samp class="ph codeph">IloModeler</samp> as an argument since modeling
by column is not available with <samp class="ph codeph">IloModeler</samp> .</p>
<p class="p">First, the function creates an empty minimization objective
and empty ranged constraints, and adds them to the active model. </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> IloObjective cost       = model.addMinimize();
    IloRange[]   constraint = new IloRange[nNutrs];
  
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; nNutrs; i++) {
       constraint[i] = model.addRange(data.nutrMin[i], data.nutrMax[i]);
    }
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Empty means that they use a <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp> expression.
After that the variables are created one by one, and installed in
the objective and constraints modeling by column. For each variable,
a column object must be created. Start by creating a column object
for the objective by calling: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> IloColumn col = model.column(cost, data.foodCost[j]);
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The column is then expanded to include the coefficients
for all the constraints using <samp class="ph codeph">col.and</samp> with
the column objects that are created for each constraint, as in the
following loop: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> for (int i = 0; i &lt; nNutrs; i++) {
        col = col.and(model.column(constraint[i], data.nutrPerFood[i][j]));
      }
</code></pre>
<p class="p">When the full column object has been constructed it is
finally used to create and install the new variable like this: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Buy[j] = model.numVar(col, data.foodMin[j], data.foodMax[j], type);</code></pre>
<p class="p">After the model has been created, solving it and querying
the solution is straightforward. What remains to be pointed out is
the exception handling. In case of an error, CPLEX throws an exception
of type <samp class="ph codeph">IloException</samp> or one of its subclasses.
Thus the entire CPLEX program is enclosed in <samp class="ph codeph">try/catch</samp> statements.
The <samp class="ph codeph">InputDataReader</samp> can throw exceptions
of type <samp class="ph codeph">java.io.IOException</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">InputDataReader.InputDataReaderException</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">Since none of these three possible exceptions is handled
elsewhere, the <samp class="ph codeph">main</samp> function ends by catching
them and issuing appropriate error messages.</p>
<p class="p">The call to the method <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.end</samp> frees
the memory that CPLEX uses.</p>
<p class="p">The entire source code listing for the example is available
as <samp class="ph codeph">Diet.java</samp> in the standard distribution
at <em class="ph i">yourCPLEXinstallation</em> <samp class="ph codeph">/examples/src.</samp> </p>
