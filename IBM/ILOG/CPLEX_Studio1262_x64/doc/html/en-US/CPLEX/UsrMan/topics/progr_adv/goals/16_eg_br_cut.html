<h1 class="title topictitle1">Example: goals in branch &amp; cut</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Illustrates goals in a C++ application.</p>
<p class="p">Consider the following example to clarify the discussions
of goals. This example is available as <samp class="ph codeph">ilogoalex1.cpp</samp> in
the <samp class="ph codeph">examples/src</samp> subdirectory of your CPLEX
distribution. The equivalent Java implementation can be found as <samp class="ph codeph">GoalEx1.java</samp> in
the same location. The C#.NET version is in <samp class="ph codeph">Goalex1.cs</samp> and
the VB.NET version is in <samp class="ph codeph">Goalex1.vb</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">This example shows how to implement and use a goal for
controlling the branch strategy used by CPLEX. As discussed, goals
are implemented as subclasses of the class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI</samp> 
(<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.Goal</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.Goal</samp>).
The C++ implementation of that example uses the macro</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ILOCPLEXGOAL1(MyBranchGoal, IloNumVarArray, vars)</code></pre>
<p class="p">instead. This macro defines two things, class <samp class="ph codeph">MyBranchGoalI</samp> 
and the function </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloCplex::Goal MyBranchGoal(IloEnv env, IloNumVarArray vars);</code></pre>
<p class="p">The class <samp class="ph codeph">MyBranchGoalI</samp> is
defined as a subclass of class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI</samp> 
(<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.Goal</samp> or<samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.Goal</samp> )
and has a private member <samp class="ph codeph">IloNumVarArray</samp>  <samp class="ph codeph">vars</samp>.
The function <samp class="ph codeph">MyBranchGoal</samp> creates an instance
of class <samp class="ph codeph">MyBranchGoalI</samp>, initializes the
member <samp class="ph codeph">vars</samp>  to the argument <samp class="ph codeph">vars</samp> 
passed to the function, and returns a handle to the new goal object.
The curly brackets "{ ... }" following the macro enclose the implementation
of the method <samp class="ph codeph">MyBranchGoalI::execute</samp> containing
the actual code of the goal.</p>
<p class="p">The use of the macro is very convenient as the amount
of user code is equivalent to the amount for defining a function,
but with a slightly unusual syntax. <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> provides
seven such macros that can be used for defining goals with 0 to 6
private members. If more than 6 members are needed, <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI</samp> 
(<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.Goal</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.Goal</samp>)
must be subclassed <em class="ph i">by hand</em>.</p>
<p class="p">Since the <strong class="ph b">Java</strong> programming
language does not provide macros, a subclass of <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.Goal</samp> must
always be implemented by hand. In this example, this class is called <samp class="ph codeph">MyBranchGoal</samp> and
there is no helper function for creating an instance of that class
(as the macro does in the case of C++). </p>
<p class="p">The goal is then used for solving the extracted node
by calling:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cplex.solve(MyBranchGoal(env, var));</code></pre>
<p class="p">for <strong class="ph b">C++</strong>, or for <strong class="ph b">Java</strong>:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cplex.solve(new MyBranchGoal(var));</code></pre>
<p class="p">instead of the usual <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.solve</samp>.
The rest of the <samp class="ph codeph">main</samp> function contains
nothing new and will not be discussed any further.</p>
<p class="p">In the implementation of the goal, or more precisely
its method <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp>, starts by declaring
and initializing some arrays. These arrays are then used by methods
of class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI</samp>  (<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.Goal</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.Goal</samp>)
to query information about the node subproblem and the solution of
its relaxation. The method <samp class="ph codeph">getValues</samp> is
used to query the solution values for the variables in <samp class="ph codeph">vars</samp>,
the method <samp class="ph codeph">getObjCoefs</samp> is used to query
the linear objective function coefficients for these variables, and
method <samp class="ph codeph">getFeasibilities</samp> is used to query
feasibility statuses for them. The feasibility status of a variable
indicates whether <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex</samp> considers the
current solution value of the variable to be integer feasible or not. <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::GoalI</samp> 
(<samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.Goal</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.Goal</samp>)
provides a wealth of other query methods. For details, see the <em class="ph i">CPLEX Reference Manuals</em>.</p>
<p class="p">After you have gathered information about the variables,
their objective coefficients, and their current feasibility statuses,
compute the index of an integer infeasible variable in <samp class="ph codeph">vars</samp> that
has the largest objective coefficients among the variables with largest
integer infeasibility. That index is recorded in variable <samp class="ph codeph">bestj</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">Then create a new goal handle object <samp class="ph codeph">res</samp>.
By default, this is initialized to an empty goal. However, if an integer
infeasible variable was found among those in <samp class="ph codeph">vars</samp>,
then variable <samp class="ph codeph">bestj</samp> will be ≥<samp class="ph codeph">0</samp> and
a nonempty goal will be assigned to <samp class="ph codeph">res</samp>: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>res = AndGoal(OrGoal(vars[bestj] &gt;= IloFloor(x[bestj])+1,
                     vars[bestj] &lt;= IloFloor(x[bestj])),
                     this);</code></pre>
<p class="p">This goal creates two branches, one for </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../images/goals5.gif" alt="goals5.gif" /> <samp class="ph codeph"> </samp> </p>
<p class="p">and one for </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../images/goals6.gif" alt="goals6.gif" /> </p>
<p class="p">and continues branching in both subtrees with the same
goal <samp class="ph codeph">this</samp>. Finally, call method <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp> for
all temporary arrays and return goal <samp class="ph codeph">res</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">Since Java objects are garbage collected, there is no
need for the variable <samp class="ph codeph">res</samp>. Instead, depending
on the availability of an integer infeasible variable, the <samp class="ph codeph">null</samp> goal
is returned or the returned goal is created in the return statement
itself: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>return cplex.and(cplex.or(cplex.geGoal(_vars[bestj],
                          Math.floor(x[bestj]))+1,
                          cplex.leGoal(_vars[bestj],
                          Math.floor(x[bestj]))),
                 this);</code></pre>
