<h1 class="title topictitle1">Determinism and the timing interface</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Defines determinism in the context of the timing
interface for accessing time stamps.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Determinism</strong> means that repeated solving of the same model
with the same parameter settings, including limits, on the same computing
platform will follow exactly the same solution path, yielding the
same level of performance and the same values in the solution. </p>
<p class="p">In contrast to determinism, the concept of <strong class="ph b">opportunism</strong> implies
taking advantage of opportunities to improve performance even though
these advantages in performance may result in a different path to
the solution or possibly even in different results. </p>
<p class="p">System time (such as CPU time measured in seconds or wall clock
time measured in seconds) is <strong class="ph b">not</strong> deterministic; in other words,
it may vary from one run to another. For example, the load of other
applications on a system can impact performance and thus influence
system time. Consequently, two consecutive runs even with the same
time limit may yield results that are not deterministic. </p>
<p class="p">For situations where the user requires deterministic results, CPLEX
offers a choice between deterministic and opportunistic algorithms.
For a comparison and contrast of determinism and opportunism in the
context of parallel algorithms, for example, see the topic 
<a class="xref" href="../../parallel_optim/multi_threaded_parallel/07_determinism.html" title="Defines determinism and describes its effect in parallel optimization.">Determinism of results</a>. </p>
<p class="p">CPLEX also offers the user a choice between time limits measured
in seconds (that is, dependent on system time) and time limits measured
deterministically. 
The options of system time measured in seconds and deterministic time 
measured in ticks (on the one hand) or parallelism and opportunism (on the other) 
are orthogonal to one another.  That is, 
you can set a system time limit on a deterministic parallel algorithm, 
but of course then the termination criterion will not be deterministic because it depends on
nondeterministic system time measured in seconds. You can likewise set a deterministic time limit 
on an opportunistic parallel optimization. In that case, the termination criterion, 
indeed, the entire run will not be deterministic because of the opportunism of the 
parallel optimization. In other words, you can mix and match these options, but you 
must give careful consideration to the effect you want to achieve in doing so. </p>
<p class="p">You can even set both a deterministic and a system time limit simultaneously. 
In such a case, CPLEX stops the optimization as soon as it reaches one of the limits 
(similar to what happens when you set both a MIP gap and a node limit in a MIP optimization).</p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> If you want a fully deterministic optimization, 
then you need to apply a deterministic algorithm, and 
you must <strong class="ph b">not</strong> use a wall-clock time limit nor a CPU time limit. </div>
