<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Introduces FeasOpt as a tool for repairing infeasibility
in LP models.</p>
<p class="p">Previous sections focused on how to diagnose the causes
of infeasibility. However, you may want to go beyond diagnosis to
perform automatic correction of your model and then proceed with delivering
a solution. One approach for doing so is to build your model with
explicit slack variables and other modeling constructs, so that an
infeasible outcome is never a possibility. Such techniques for formulating
a model are beyond the scope of this discussion, but you should consider
them if you want the greatest possible flexibility in your application.</p>
<p class="p">In contrast, an automated approach offered in CPLEX is
known as FeasOpt (for feasible optimization). FeasOpt attempts to
repair an infeasibility by modifying the model according to preferences
set by the user. For more about this approach, see <a class="xref" href="../../infeas_unbd/feasopt/01_feasopt_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents FeasOpt, a feature for repairing infeasibility in a model.">Repairing infeasibilities with FeasOpt</a> </p>
