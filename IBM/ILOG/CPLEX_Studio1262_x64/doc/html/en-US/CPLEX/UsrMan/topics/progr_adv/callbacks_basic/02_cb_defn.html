<h1 class="title topictitle1">What are callbacks?</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Defines callbacks.</p>
<p class="p">Callbacks allow you to monitor closely and to guide the
behavior of CPLEX  
optimizers. In particular, callbacks allow user code to be executed
regularly during an optimization or during a tuning session. To use
callbacks (either optimization or tuning callbacks) with CPLEX, you
must first write the callback function, and then pass it to CPLEX.
The topic <a class="xref" href="../../progr_consid/tuning/15_tuning_cb.html" title="Describes callbacks available to the tuning tool.">Callbacks for tuning</a> offers
information about callbacks specific to a tuning session. This part
of the manual concentrates on optimization callbacks, and the topic <a class="xref" href="../callbacks_adv/01_adv_callbacks_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents the advanced MIP control interface.">Advanced MIP control interface</a> offers further information beyond this introduction
to optimization callbacks. There are three types of optimization callbacks:
informational callbacks, query callbacks, and control callbacks. </p>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_callbacks.1046303__section1304337441108"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Callbacks in the class hierarchy of the APIs</h2><p class="p">Each of the application programming interfaces (APIs)
of CPLEX supports callbacks. That is, you can write callbacks to use
with CPLEX in your preferred programming language, whether it is C,
C++, Java, C#.NET, or Python.</p>
<p class="p">The callback class hierarchy for <strong class="ph b">Java</strong> and
.NET is exactly the same as the hierarchy for C++, but the class names
differ, in that there is no <samp class="ph codeph">I</samp> at the end.
For example, the Java implementation class corresponding to the C++
class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::OptimizationCallbackI</samp> is <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex.OptimizationCallback</samp>.
 </p>
<p class="p">The names of callback classes in <strong class="ph b">.NET</strong> correspond
very closely to those in the C++ and Java APIs. However, the name
of a .NET class does not begin with <samp class="ph codeph">Ilo</samp>.
Furthermore, the names of .NET methods are capitalized (that is, they
begin with an uppercase character) according to .NET conventions.
For example, the corresponding callback class in .NET is <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex.OptimizationCallback</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">Similarly, callbacks in Python follow the usual Python
naming conventions for classes, modules, and packages. Thus, the <strong class="ph b">Python</strong> name
of the callback class corresponding to the C++ class <samp class="ph codeph">IloCplex::MIPInfoCallback</samp> is <samp class="ph codeph">callbacks.MIPInfoCallback</samp>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="User_manual.uss_callbacks.1046303__section1304337449530"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Callbacks and the CPLEX environment</h2><p class="p">Depending on the programming language you choose, you
may need to pay more or less attention to the CPLEX environment when
you write and use callbacks in your application.</p>
<p class="p">In <strong class="ph b">Java</strong>, <strong class="ph b">.NET</strong>,
and <strong class="ph b">Python</strong> applications, the CPLEX
environment is not exposed to your application, so you need not worry
about using the correct environment. Thus your only concern with respect
to the CPLEX environment is that your callback must not modify the
model currently being optimized.</p>
<p class="p">In contrast, in a <strong class="ph b">C++</strong> application,
the environment to use depends on your purpose.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">In most cases, use the environment returned
by the member function <samp class="ph codeph">getEnv</samp> of the callback
class. The environment returned by <samp class="ph codeph">getEnv</samp> of
the callback class in some cases may be the same environment used
in the current optimization. In such cases, it is valid to use that
environment in these particular places. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If you create a new problem in a callback,
and you want that object to endure after the optimization, then you
should use a new environment that is not currently used by the optimization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In an application of the Callable Library (<strong class="ph b">C
API</strong>), one of the arguments passed to your callback
specifies an environment. Problem objects you create in an environment
will be destroyed as soon as that environment is destroyed. According
to what you want CPLEX to do after optimization, this environment
may or may not be the environment you should use in your callback. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">In most cases, if at all possible, use
the same environment passed to the callback and no other environment.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If you create a problem object in your
callback, and you want that problem object to endure after the optimization
routine (such as <samp class="ph codeph">CPXlpopt</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPXmipopt</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPXbaropt</samp>,
or another) terminates, then do <strong class="ph b">not</strong> use
the environment passed to the callback function. Instead, create a
new environment that is not used in an optimization function, and
use this new environment to create the enduring problem object of
your callback.</p>
