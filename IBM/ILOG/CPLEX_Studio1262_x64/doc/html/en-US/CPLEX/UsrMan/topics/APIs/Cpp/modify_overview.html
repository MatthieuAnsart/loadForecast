<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Outlines different ways to modify a model for CPLEX in
a C++ application.</p>
<p class="p">In some applications, you may want to solve another model
or a modification of your original model, in order, for example, to
analyze a scenario or to make adaptations based on the solution of
the first model. To do this, you do not have to start a new model
from scratch, but instead you can take an existing model and change
it to your needs. To do so, call the modification methods of the individual
modeling objects. </p>
<p class="p">When an extracted model is modified, the modification
is tracked in the <samp class="ph codeph">cplex</samp> object through <em class="ph i">notification</em>. Whenever a modification
method is called, <samp class="ph codeph">cplex</samp>objects that have
extracted the model are notified about it. The <samp class="ph codeph">cplex</samp> objects
then track the modification in their internal data structures. </p>
<p class="p">Not only does CPLEX track all modifications of the model
it has extracted, but also it tries to maintain as much solution information
from a previous invocation of  <a class="xref hardcodedApiLink" href="../../../../../refcppcplex/html/classes/IloCplex.html#solve" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">solve</a> as is possible
and reasonable. </p>
<p class="p">You have already encountered what is perhaps the most
important modification method, that is, the method <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel::add</samp> for
adding modeling objects to a model. Conversely, you may call <samp class="ph codeph">IloModel::remove</samp> to
remove a modeling object from a model. </p>
<p class="p">Objective functions can be modified by changing their
sense and by editing their expression, or by changing their expression
completely. </p>
<p class="p">Similarly, the bounds of constraints and their expressions
can be modified. </p>
<p class="p">For a complete list of supported modifications, see the
documentation of the individual modeling objects in the reference
manual.</p>
