<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the effect of optimality tolerance on performance.</p>
<p class="p">Sometimes CPLEX finds a good integer solution early,
but must examine many additional nodes to prove that the solution is optimal.
You can speed up the process in such a case if you are willing to
change the optimality tolerance. CPLEX supports two kinds of tolerance:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Relative optimality tolerance 
guarantees that a solution lies within a certain percentage of the optimal solution.
Relative optimality tolerance is regulated by the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_EPGAP, EpGap</samp>.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Absolute optimality tolerance guarantees
that a solution lies within a certain absolute range of the optimal
solution. Absolute optimality tolerance is regulated by the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_EPAGAP, EpAGap</samp>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The default relative optimality tolerance is 0.0001.
At this tolerance, the final integer solution is guaranteed to be
within 0.01% of the optimal value. Of course, many formulations of
integer or mixed integer programs do not require such tight tolerance,
so requiring CPLEX to seek integer solutions that meet this tolerance
in those cases is wasted computation. If you can accept greater optimality
tolerance in your model, then you should change the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">EpGap</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">If, however, you know that the objective values of your
problem are near zero, then you should change the absolute gap because
percentages of very small numbers are less useful as optimality tolerance.
Change the parameter <samp class="ph codeph">EpAGap</samp> in this case.</p>
<p class="p">To speed up the proof of optimality, you can set objective
difference parameters, both relative and absolute. Setting these parameters
helps when there are many integer solutions with similar objective
values. For example, setting the <samp class="ph codeph">ObjDif</samp> parameter
to <samp class="ph codeph">100.0</samp> makes CPLEX skip any potential
solution with its objective value within 100.0 units of the best integer
solution so far. Or, setting the <samp class="ph codeph">RelObjDif</samp> 
to <samp class="ph codeph">0.01</samp> would mean that CPLEX would skip
any potential new solution that is not at least 1% better than the
incumbent solution. Naturally, since this objective difference setting
may make CPLEX skip an interval where the true integer optimum may
be found, the objective difference setting weakens the guarantee of
optimality. </p>
<p class="p">Cutoff parameters can also be helpful in restricting
the search for optimality, for example, when you already know 
solutions that have an objective value 
worse than a given value, or when you know that there are solutions within
a certain distance of the initial relaxation of your problem. 
In such a case, you can readily set 
the upper cutoff parameter for minimization problems
and the lower cutoff parameter for maximization problems. Set the
parameters <samp class="ph codeph">CutUp</samp>  and <samp class="ph codeph">CutLo</samp> ,
respectively, to establish a cutoff value.</p>
<p class="p">When you set a MIP cutoff value, CPLEX searches with
the same solution strategy as though it had already found an integer
solution, using a node selection strategy that differs from the one
it uses before a first solution has been found.</p>
