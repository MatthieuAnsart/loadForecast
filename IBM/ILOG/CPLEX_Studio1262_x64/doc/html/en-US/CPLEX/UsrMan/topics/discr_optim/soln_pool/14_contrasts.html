<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Contrasts the populate procedure with MIP optimization.</p>
<p class="p">Both MIP optimization and populate generate a series
of solutions, but the two procedures differ in their aims. The aim
of MIP optimization is optimality: after a solution has been found,
MIP optimization prunes nodes unless they yield solutions of improving
objective value, and the procedure will stop when optimality has been
proven. In contrast, the aim of populate is to generate as many solutions
as possible: after a solution has been found, populate may generate
solutions of both improving and degrading objective value because
it has retained nodes that may contain such solutions. It will stop
only when it cannot generate any additional solutions or because other
stopping criteria intervene. </p>
<p class="p">In order to decide which procedure is better for your
application, you should first try the MIP optimizer. If the solutions
produced are sufficient for your application, then the MIP optimizer
is the appropriate choice. If not, then you should try populate to
generate more solutions and to have more control over the properties
of the generated solutions.</p>
