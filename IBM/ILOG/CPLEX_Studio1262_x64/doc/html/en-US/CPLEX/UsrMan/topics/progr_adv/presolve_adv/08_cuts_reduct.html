<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes presolve reductions influenced by cuts.</p>
<p class="p">Cutting planes in mixed integer programming are handled
somewhat differently than one might expect. If a user wants to add
his or her own cuts during the branch &amp; cut process (through <samp class="ph codeph">CPXaddusercuts</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">CPXcutcallbackadd</samp>), it may appear necessary to turn off dual reductions to accommodate
them. (In fact, in this respect, these cuts differ from lazy constraints
discussed in <a class="xref" href="../usr_cut_lazy_constr/01_uc_lc_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents pools of user-defined cuts and lazy constraints.">User-cut and lazy-constraint pools</a>.) </p>
<p class="p">However, for reasons that are complex and beyond the
scope of this discussion, dual reductions can be left on. The reasons
relate to the fact that valid cuts never exclude integer feasible
solutions, so dual reductions performed for the original problem are
still valid after cutting planes are applied. </p>
<p class="p">However, a small set of reductions does need to be turned
off. Recall that presolve must translate a new constraint on the original
problem into a constraint on variables in the presolved model. Most
reductions performed by CPLEX presolve replace variables with linear
expressions of zero or more other variables (plus a constant). A few
do not. These latter reductions make it impossible to perform the
translation to the presolved model. Set the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/PreLinear.html" title="Decides whether linear or full reductions occur during preprocessing.">linear reduction switch</a> <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_PRELINEAR</samp> to 0 (zero) to forbid these latter
reductions.</p>
