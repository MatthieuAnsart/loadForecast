<h1 class="title topictitle1">Technical limits of distributed branch and bound</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Documents limits of distributed branch.</p>
<p class="p">If you are already familiar with solving a mixed integer program (MIP) by means of conventional 
CPLEX MIP optimization, there are a few technical differences in distributed parallel MIP optimization 
that are worth noting.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">No control or query callbacks</h2>
<p class="p">Distributed parallel MIP does not support control callbacks.
Distributed parallel MIP does not support query callbacks.
However, you can use informational callbacks with distributed parallel MIP. 
An informational callback pertains to the master (not the workers).
Furthermore, during rampup, there is no uniquely defined tree. 
Consequently, callback information 
that depends on specifics of a branch and bound tree does not exist. 
For more detail about the situations in which informational callbacks work 
with distributed parallel MIP, see the announcement 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../ReleaseNotes/topics/releasenotes126/newInfoCallbacksAndDistribMIP.html" title="Documents informational callbacks in CPLEX V12.6.0 to support distributed parallel optimization of mixed integer programs (MIP).">Informational callbacks and distributed MIP</a>. 
For definitions of informational, query, and control callbacks, see the topic 
<a class="xref" href="../../progr_adv/callbacks_basic/01_cb_title_synopsis.html" title="Introduces optimization callbacks.">Using optimization callbacks</a> 
in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX User's Manual</em>. For examples of informational callbacks, see 
these samples provided with the product:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">No restarting a run from where it stopped</h2>
<p class="p">Distributed parallel MIP always starts from scratch. 
In contrast, with the conventional MIP optimizer, you can 
specify limits, reach them, and restart.
For example, you can specify a limit on the number of nodes to solve 
and solve your MIP conventionally with shared memory, stopping when 
the node limit occurs; you can then extend the limit on nodes to a greater 
number and invoke solve again. With conventional MIP with shared memory, the 
second solve takes up where the first solve stopped.</p>

<p class="p">This pattern of stopping and restarting from a previous point is not 
possible with distributed parallel MIP. If you attempt that scenario of 
solving to a node limit, stopping at the limit, extending the limit to a 
greater number, and restarting, distributed parallel MIP simply starts over 
from scratch (not from the state when it reached the previous limit).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mix and match still starts from scratch</h2>
<p class="p">Likewise, if you mix calls to conventional MIP with shared memory with calls 
to distributed parallel MIP, the call to distributed parallel MIP will always 
start from scratch. In fact, if you begin with distributed parallel MIP optimization, 
let it run to a limit (such as a time limit, node limit, solutions limit), and then  
invoke conventional MIP optimization, even the conventional MIP starts over 
from scratch. It does not use any of the information accumulated in the previous 
optimization.</p>
