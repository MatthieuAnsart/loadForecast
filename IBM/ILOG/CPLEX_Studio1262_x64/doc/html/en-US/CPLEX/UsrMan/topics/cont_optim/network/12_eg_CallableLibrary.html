<h1 class="title topictitle1">Example: using the network optimizer with the Callable Library
netex1.c</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Demonstrates an example of the network optimizer in the
C API.</p>
<p class="p">In the standard distribution of CPLEX, the file <samp class="ph codeph">netex1.c</samp> contains
code that creates, solves, and displays the solution of the network-flow
problem illustrated in <a class="xref" href="05_eg_Interactive_prob_descrip.html#User_manual.uss_solveNet.653116__User_manual.uss_solveNet.657919">Figure 1</a>. </p>
<p class="p">Briefly, the <samp class="ph codeph">main</samp> function initializes the CPLEX
environment and creates the problem object; it also calls the optimizer
to solve the problem and retrieves the solution. </p>
<p class="p">In detail, <samp class="ph codeph">main</samp> first calls the Callable Library
routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/openCPLEX.html" title="The routine CPXXopenCPLEX/CPXopenCPLEX initializes a CPLEX environment.">CPXopenCPLEX</a></samp>.
As explained in <a class="xref" href="../../APIs/C/07_init_env.html" title="Tells how to initialize the environment in the C API.">Initialize the CPLEX environment</a>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPXopenCPLEX</samp> must
always be the first CPLEX routine called in a Callable Library application.
Those routines create the CPLEX environment and return a pointer (called <samp class="ph codeph">env</samp>)
to it. This pointer will be passed to every Callable Library routine.
If this initialization routine fails, <samp class="ph codeph">env</samp>  will be <samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> and
the error code indicating the reason for the failure will be written
to <samp class="ph codeph">status</samp>. That error code can be transformed into
a string by the Callable Library routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/geterrorstring.html" title="The routine CPXXgeterrorstring/CPXgeterrorstring returns an error message string corresponding to an error code.">CPXgeterrorstring</a></samp>.</p>
<p class="p">After <samp class="ph codeph">main</samp> initializes the CPLEX environment,
it uses the Callable Library routine <samp class="ph codeph"><a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/setintparam.html" title="The routine CPXXsetintparam/CPXsetintparam sets the value of a CPLEX parameter of type CPXINT.">CPXsetintparam</a></samp> to
turn on the CPLEX <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/SCRIND.html" title="Decides whether or not results are displayed on screen in an application of the C API.">messages to screen switch</a> parameter <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_SCRIND</samp> so
that CPLEX output appears on screen. If this parameter is turned off,
CPLEX does not produce viewable output, neither on screen, nor in
a log file. It is a good idea to turn this parameter on when you are
debugging your application.</p>
<p class="p">The Callable Library routine <a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/netapi/NETcreateprob.html" title="The routine CPXXNETcreateprob/CPXNETcreateprob constructs a new network problem object.">CPXNETcreateprob</a> creates
an empty problem object, that is, a minimum-cost network-flow problem
with no arcs and no nodes.</p>
<p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">buildNetwork</samp> populates the problem
object; that is, it loads the problem data into the problem object.
Pointer variables in the example are initialized as <samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> 
so that you can check whether they point to valid data (a good programming
practice). The most important calls in this function are to the Callable
Library routines, <a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/netapi/NETaddnodes.html" title="The routine CPXXNETaddnodes/CPXNETaddnodes adds new nodes to the network stored in a network problem object.">CPXNETaddnodes</a>,
which adds nodes with the specified supply values to the network problem,
and <a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/netapi/NETaddarcs.html" title="The routine CPXXNETaddarcs/CPXNETaddarcs adds new arcs to the network stored in a network problem object.">CPXNETaddarcs</a>,
which adds the arcs connecting the nodes with the specified objective
values and bounds. In this example, both routines are called with
their last argument <samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> indicating that no names
are assigned to the network nodes and arcs. If you want to name arcs
and nodes in your problem, pass an array of strings instead.</p>
<p class="p">The function <samp class="ph codeph">buildNetwork</samp> also includes a few
routines that are not strictly necessary to this example, but illustrate
concepts you may find useful in other applications. To delete a node
and all arcs dependent on that node, it uses the Callable Library
routine <a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/netapi/NETdelnodes.html" title="The routine CPXXNETdelnodes/CPXNETdelnodes is used to remove a range of nodes from the network stored in a network problem object.">CPXNETdelnodes</a>.
To change the objective sense to minimization, it uses the Callable
Library routine <a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/netapi/NETchgobjsen.html" title="The routine CPXXNETchgobjsen/CPXNETchgobjsen is used to change the sense of the network problem to a minimization or maximization problem.">CPXNETchgobjsen</a>.</p>
<p class="p">Look again at <samp class="ph codeph">main</samp> , where it actually calls the
network optimizer with the Callable Library routine, <a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/netapi/NETprimopt.html" title="The routine CPXXNETprimopt/CPXNETprimopt can be called after a network problem has been copied to a network problem object, to find a solution to that problem using the primal network simplex method.">CPXNETprimopt</a>.
If <samp class="ph codeph">CPXNETprimopt</samp>  returns a nonzero value, then an
error has occurred; otherwise, the optimization was successful. Before
retrieving that solution, it is necessary to allocate arrays to hold
it. Then use <a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/netapi/NETsolution.html" title="The routine CPXXNETsolution/CPXNETsolution accesses solution values for a network problem object computed by the most recent call to CPXXNETprimopt/CPXNETprimopt for that object.">CPXNETsolution</a> to
copy the solution into those arrays. After displaying the solution
on screen, write the network problem into a file, <samp class="ph codeph">netex1.net</samp> in
the NET file format.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">TERMINATE</samp>: label is used as a place for the
program to exit if any type of error occurs. Therefore, code following
this label cleans up: it frees the memory that has been allocated
for the solution data; it frees the network object by calling <a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/netapi/NETfreeprob.html" title="The routine CPXXNETfreeprob/CPXNETfreeprob deletes the network problem object pointed to by net_p.">CPXNETfreeprob</a>;
and it frees the CPLEX environment by calling <a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/cpxapi/closeCPLEX.html" title="This routine frees all of the data structures associated with CPLEX.">CPXcloseCPLEX</a>.
All freeing should be done only if the data is actually available.
The Callable Library routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXcloseCPLEX</samp> should
always be the last CPLEX routine called in a Callable Library application.
In other words, all CPLEX objects that have been allocated should
be freed before the call to <samp class="ph codeph">CPXcloseCPLEX</samp> .</p>
<p class="p">The complete program <samp class="ph codeph">netex1.c</samp> appears online in
the standard distribution at <em class="ph i">yourCPLEXinstallation</em> <samp class="ph codeph">/examples/src</samp>.</p>
