<h1 class="title topictitle1">The goal stack</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the goal stack.</p>
<p class="p">To understand how goals are executed, consider the concept
of the <em class="ph i">goal stack</em>.
Every node has its own goal stack. When  <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.solve(goal)</samp> 
is called, the goal stack of the root node is simply initialized with <samp class="ph codeph">goal</samp> 
and then the regular <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.solve</samp>  method
is called.</p>
<p class="p">When CPLEX processes a node, it pops the first goal from
the node's goal stack and calls method <samp class="ph codeph">execute</samp>.
If a nonempty goal is returned, it is simply pushed back on the stack.
CPLEX keeps doing this until the node becomes inactive or the node's
goal stack becomes empty. When the node stack is empty, CPLEX continues
with its built-in search strategy for the subtree rooted at this node.</p>
<p class="p">In light of the goal stack, here are the different types
of goals:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">As explained in <a class="xref" href="08_or_goal.html" title="Describes the Or goal to create subnodes of the current node.">Or goal</a>,
the Or goal creates child nodes. CPLEX first initializes the goal
stack of every child node with a copy of the remaining goal stack
of the current node. Then it pushes the goal passed as the argument
to the Or goal on the goal stack of the corresponding node. Finally,
the current node is deactivated, and CPLEX continues search by picking
a new active node from the tree to process.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The And goal simply pushes the goals
passed as arguments onto the goal stack in reverse order. Thus, when
the goals are popped from the stack for execution, they will be executed
in the same order as they were passed as arguments to the And goal.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">When a Fail goal executes, the current
node is simply deactivated, and CPLEX continues on another active
node from the tree. In other words, CPLEX discontinues its search
below the current node.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">When a local cut goal is executed, its
constraints are added to the node problem as local cuts and the relaxation
is re-solved.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">An empty goal cannot be executed. Thus,
empty goals are not pushed onto the goal stack. If the goal stack
is empty, CPLEX continues with the built-in branching strategy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">With this understanding, consider further what really
goes on when a goal returns: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>return AndGoal(OrGoal(var &lt;= IloFloor(val), var &gt;= IloFloor(val)+1), this);</code></pre>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">And</samp>  goal is pushed onto
the current node's goal stack, only to be immediately popped back
off of it. When it is executed, it will push <samp class="ph codeph">this</samp> on
the goal stack and then push the Or goal. Thus, the Or goal is the
next goal that CPLEX pops and executes. The Or goal creates two subnodes,
and initializes their goal stacks with copies of the goal stack of
the current node. At this point both subnodes will have <samp class="ph codeph">this</samp> on
top of their goal stacks. Next, the Or goal will push a local cut
goal for </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../images/goals7.gif" alt="goals7.gif" /> </p>
<p class="p">(where</p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="../../../images/goals8.gif" alt="goals8.gif" /> </p>
<p class="p">denotes the floor of <samp class="ph codeph">val)</samp> on
the goal stack of the first subnode. Similarly, it pushes a local
cut goal for</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">var</samp>  ≥<img class="image" src="../../../images/goals9.gif" alt="goals9.gif" /> </p>
<p class="p">on the goal stack of the second subnode. Finally, the
current node is deactivated and CPLEX continues its search with a
new active node from the tree.</p>
<p class="p">When CPLEX processes one of the subnodes that have been
created by the Or goal, it will pop and execute the first goal from
the node's goal stack. As you just saw, this will be a local cut goal.
Thus CPLEX adds the constraint to the node problem and re-solves the
relaxation. Next, <samp class="ph codeph">this</samp> will be popped from
the goal stack and executed. That fact means that the same search
strategy as implemented in the original goal is applied at that node.</p>
