<h1 class="title topictitle1">What is column generation?</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Defines column generation.</p>
<p class="p">In colloquial terms, column generation is a way of beginning
with a small, manageable part of a problem (specifically, a few of
the variables), solving that part, analyzing that partial solution
to discover the next part of the problem (specifically, one or more
variables) to add to the model, and then resolving the enlarged model.
Column generation repeats that process until it achieves a satisfactory
solution to the whole of the problem. </p>
<p class="p">In formal terms, column generation is a way of solving
a linear programming problem that adds columns (corresponding to constrained
variables) during the pricing phase of the simplex method of solving
the problem. In gross terms, generating a column in the primal simplex
formulation of a linear programming problem corresponds to adding
a constraint in its dual formulation. In the dual formulation of a
given linear programming problem, you might think of column generation
as a cutting plane method. </p>
<p class="p">In that context, many researchers have observed that
column generation is a very powerful technique for solving a wide
range of industrial problems to optimality or to near optimality.
Ford and Fulkerson, for example, suggested column generation in the
context of a multi-commodity network flow problem as early as 1958
in the journal of Management Science. By 1960, Dantzig and Wolfe had
adapted it to linear programming problems with a decomposable structure.
Gilmore and Gomory then demonstrated its effectiveness in a cutting
stock problem. More recently, vehicle routing, crew scheduling, and
other integer-constrained problems have motivated further research
into column generation.</p>
<p class="p">Column generation rests on the fact that in the simplex
method, the solver does not need access to all the variables of the
problem simultaneously. In fact, a solver can begin work with only
the basis (a particular subset of the constrained variables) and then
use reduced cost to decide which other variables to access as needed. </p>
