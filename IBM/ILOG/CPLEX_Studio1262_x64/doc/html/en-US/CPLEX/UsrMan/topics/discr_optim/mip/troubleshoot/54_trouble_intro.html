<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the background of MIP performance problems.</p>
<p class="p">Even the most sophisticated methods currently available
to solve pure integer and mixed integer programming problems require
noticeably more computation than the methods for similarly sized continuous
problems. Many relatively small integer programming models still take
enormous amounts of computing time to solve. Indeed, some such models
have never yet been solved. In the face of these practical obstacles
to a solution, proper formulation of the model is crucial to successful
solution of pure integer or mixed integer programs.</p>
<p class="p">For help in formulating a model of your own integer or
mixed integer problem, you may want to consult H.P. Williams’s
textbook about practical model building (referenced in <a class="xref" href="../../../preface/biblio.html" title="Recommends further reading about related topics.">Further reading</a> in
the preface of this manual). </p>
<p class="p">Also you may want to develop a better understanding of
the branch &amp; cut algorithm. For that purpose, Williams’s
book offers a good introduction, and Nemhauser and Wolsey’s
book (also referenced in <a class="xref" href="../../../preface/biblio.html" title="Recommends further reading about related topics.">Further reading</a> in
the preface of this manual) goes into greater depth about branch &amp; cut
as well as other techniques implemented in the CPLEX MIP optimizer.</p>
<p class="p"> <a class="xref" href="../performance/12_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes features for tuning performance of the MIP optimizer.">Tuning performance features of the mixed integer optimizer</a> in
this chapter has already discussed several specific features that
are important for performance tuning of difficult models. Here are
more specific performance symptoms and the remedies that can be tried.</p>
