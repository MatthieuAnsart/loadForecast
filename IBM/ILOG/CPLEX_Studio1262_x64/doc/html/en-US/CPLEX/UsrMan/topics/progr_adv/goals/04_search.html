<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes goals in relation to nodes in the search.</p>
<p class="p">The search procedure manages a search tree consisting
of nodes. Every node represents a subproblem to be solved, and the
root node of the tree represents the entire problem. Nodes are called <em class="ph i">active</em> if they have not yet been
processed.</p>
<p class="p">The tree is first initialized to contain the root node
as the only active node. CPLEX processes active nodes from the tree
until either no more active nodes are available or some limit has
been reached. After a node has been processed, it is no longer active.</p>
<p class="p">When processing a node, CPLEX starts by solving the continuous
relaxation of its subproblem (that is, the subproblem without integrality
constraints). If the solution violates any cuts, CPLEX adds them to
the node problem and re-solves. This procedure is iterated until no
more violated cuts are found by CPLEX. If at any point the relaxation
becomes infeasible, the node is pruned, that is, it is removed from
the tree.</p>
<p class="p">To solve the node problem, CPLEX checks whether the solution
satisfies the integrality constraints. If so, and if its objective
value is better than that of the current incumbent, the solution of
the node problem is used as the new incumbent. Otherwise, CPLEX splits
the node problem into one or two smaller subproblems, typically by
branching on a variable that violates its integrality constraint.
These subproblems are added to the tree as active nodes and the current
node is deactivated.</p>
<p class="p">The primary use of goals is to take control of these
last steps, namely the integer-feasibility test and the creation of
subproblems. However, as discussed later, goals also allow you to
add local and global cuts.</p>
