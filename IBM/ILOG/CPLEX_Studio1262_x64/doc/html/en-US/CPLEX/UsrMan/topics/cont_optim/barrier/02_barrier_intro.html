<h1 class="title topictitle1">Introducing the barrier optimizer</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the type of problem the barrier optimizer solves
and characterizes its approach.</p>
<p class="p">The IBM ILOG
CPLEX barrier optimizer is well suited to large, sparse problems.
An alternative to the simplex optimizers, which are also suitable
to problems in which the matrix representation is dense, the barrier
optimizer exploits a primal-dual logarithmic barrier algorithm to
generate a sequence of strictly positive primal and dual solutions
to a problem. As with the simplex optimizers, it is not really necessary
to understand the internal workings of barrier in order to obtain
its performance benefits. However, for the interested reader, here
is an outline of how it works.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX finds the primal solutions, conventionally denoted
(x, s), from the primal formulation:</p>
<p class="p">Minimize c<sup class="ph sup">T</sup>x</p>
<p class="p">subject to Ax = b </p>
<p class="p">with these bounds x + s = u and x <samp class="ph codeph">≥</samp> l </p>
<p class="p">where A is the constraint matrix, including slack and
surplus variables; u is the upper and l the lower bounds on the variables. </p>
<p class="p">Simultaneously, CPLEX automatically finds the dual solutions,
conventionally denoted (y, z, w) from the corresponding
dual formulation:</p>
<p class="p">Maximize b<sup class="ph sup">T</sup>y - u<sup class="ph sup">T</sup>w + l<sup class="ph sup">T</sup>z</p>
<p class="p">subject to A<sup class="ph sup">T</sup>y - w + z = c</p>
<p class="p">with these bounds w <samp class="ph codeph">≥</samp> 0
and z <samp class="ph codeph">≥</samp> 0</p>
<p class="p">All possible solutions maintain strictly positive primal
solutions (x - l, s) and strictly positive reduced
costs (z, w) so that the value 0 (zero) forms a barrier for primal
and dual variables within the algorithm.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX measures progress by considering the primal feasibility,
dual feasibility, and duality gap at each iteration. To measure feasibility,
CPLEX considers the accuracy with which the primal constraints (Ax = b, x + s = u)
and dual constraints (A<sup class="ph sup">T</sup>y + z - w = c)
are satisfied. The optimizer stops when it finds feasible primal and
dual solutions that are complementary. A complementary solution is
one where the sums of the products (x<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>  -l<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>)z<sub class="ph sub">j</sub> and
(u<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>  - x<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>)z<sub class="ph sub">j</sub> are
within some tolerance of 0 (zero). Since each (x<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>  -l<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>),
(u<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>  - x<sub class="ph sub">j</sub>),
and z<sub class="ph sub">j</sub> is strictly positive,
the sum can be near zero only if each of the individual products is
near zero. The sum of these products is known as the <em class="ph i">complementarity</em> of the problem.</p>
<p class="p">On each iteration of the barrier optimizer, CPLEX computes
a matrix based on AA<sup class="ph sup">T</sup> and
then computes a Cholesky factor of it. This factored matrix has the
same number of nonzeros on each iteration. The number of nonzeros
in this matrix is influenced by the barrier ordering parameter.</p>
<p class="p">The CPLEX barrier optimizer is appropriate and often
advantageous for large problems, for example, those with more than
100 000 rows or columns. It is not <em class="ph i">always</em> the
best choice, though, for sparse models with more than 100 000
rows. It is effective on problems with staircase structures or banded
structures in the constraint matrix. It is also effective on problems
with a small number of nonzeros per column (perhaps no more than a
dozen nonzero values per column).</p>
<p class="p">In short, denseness or sparsity are not the deciding
issues when you are deciding whether to use the barrier optimizer.
In fact, its performance is most dependent on these characteristics:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">the number of floating-point operations
required to compute the Cholesky factor;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">the presence of dense columns, that
is, columns with a relatively high number of nonzero entries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">To decide whether to use the barrier optimizer on a given
problem, you should look at both these characteristics, not simply
at denseness, sparseness, or problem size. (How to check those characteristics
is explained later in this chapter in <a class="xref" href="15_log_file_Cholesky.html" title="Identifies the report of the Cholesky factor in the log file of the barrier optimizer.">Cholesky factor in the log file</a>,
and <a class="xref" href="13_log_file_nonzeros.html" title="Explains report of nonzeros in the log file of the barrier optimizer.">Nonzeros in lower triangle of A*A' in the log file</a>).</p>
