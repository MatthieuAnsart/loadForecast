<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Explains how to interpret early reports of infeasibility
and how to use a parameter in diagnosis.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX preprocessing may declare a model infeasible before
the selected optimization algorithm begins. </p>
<p class="p">This early declaration saves considerable execution time
in most cases. </p>
<p class="p">When this declaration is the outcome of preprocessing,
it is important to understand that there are two classes of reductions
performed by the preprocessor: primal and dual reductions. </p>
<p class="p">Reductions that are independent of the objective function
are called <em class="ph i">primal reductions</em>; those that are independent of the righthand side (RHS) of the constraints
are called <em class="ph i">dual reductions</em>. </p>
<p class="p">Preprocessing operates on the assumption that the model
being solved is expected by the user to be feasible and that a finite
optimal solution exists. If this assumption is false, then the model
is either infeasible or no bounded optimal solutions exist; that is,
it is unbounded. </p>
<p class="p">Since primal reductions are independent of the objective
function, they cannot detect unboundedness; they can detect only infeasibility. </p>
<p class="p">Similarly, dual reductions can detect only unboundedness. </p>
<p class="p">Thus, to aid analysis of an infeasible or unbounded declaration
by the preprocessor, a parameter is provided that the user can set,
so that the optimization can be rerun to make sure that the results
reported by the preprocessor can be interpreted. The <em class="ph i">CPLEX Parameters Reference Manual</em> documents this parameter: <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/Reduce.html" title="Specifies whether primal reductions, dual reductions, both, or neither are performed during preprocessing.">primal and dual reduction type</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">Reduce</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_REDUCE</samp>). </p>
<p class="p">If a model is declared by the preprocessor to be infeasible
or unbounded and the user believes that it might be infeasible, the
parameter  can be set to 1 by the user, and the preprocessor will
perform only primal reductions. </p>
<p class="p">If the preprocessor still finds inconsistency in the
model, the preprocessor will declare the model infeasible, instead
of infeasible or unbounded. </p>
<p class="p">Similarly, setting the parameter to 2 means that if the
preprocessor detects unboundedness in the model, it will be declared
unambiguously to be unbounded. </p>
<p class="p">To control the types of reductions performed by the presolver,
set the parameter to one of the following values:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">0 = no primal and dual reductions</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">1 = only primal reductions</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">2 = only dual reductions</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">3 = both primal and dual reductions
(default)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">These settings of the parameter are intended for diagnostic
use, as turning off reductions will usually have a negative impact
on performance of the optimization algorithms in the normal (feasible
and bounded) case.</p>
