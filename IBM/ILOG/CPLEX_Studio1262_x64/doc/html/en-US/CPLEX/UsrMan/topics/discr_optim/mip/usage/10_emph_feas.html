<h1 class="title topictitle1">Emphasizing feasibility and optimality</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the context of the MIP emphasis parameter.</p>
<p class="p">The following topic, <a class="xref" href="../performance/12_title_synopsis.html" title="Describes features for tuning performance of the MIP optimizer.">Tuning performance features of the mixed integer optimizer</a>,
goes into great detail about the algorithmic features, controlled
by parameter settings, that are available in CPLEX to achieve performance
tuning on difficult MIP models. However, there is an important parameter, <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_MIPEMPHASIS</samp>,
that is oriented less toward the user understanding the algorithm
being used to solve the model, and more toward the user telling the
algorithm something about the underlying aim of the optimization being
run. That parameter is discussed here.</p>
<p class="p">Optimizing a MIP model involves:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">finding a succession of improving integer
feasible solutions (that is, solutions satisfying the linear and quadratic
constraints and the integrality conditions); while</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">also working toward a proof that no
better feasible solution exists and is undiscovered. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">For most models, a balance between these two sometimes-competing
aims works well, and this is another way of stating the philosophy
behind the default <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp>  setting:
it balances optimality and integer feasibility.</p>
<p class="p">At this default <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp> setting
of <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp> (that is, <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasisBalanced</samp> in
Concert Technology or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_BALANCED</samp> in
the Callable Library), CPLEX uses tactics intended to find a proven
optimal solution quickly, for models of a broad range of difficulty.
That is, considerable analysis of the model is performed before branching
ever begins, in the expectation that the investment will result in
a faster total run time, yet not every possible analysis is performed.
And then branching is performed in a manner that seeks to find good
quality feasible solutions, without sacrificing too much time that
could be spent proving the optimality of any solution that has already
been found.</p>
<p class="p">In many situations, the user may want a greater emphasis
on feasibility and less emphasis on analysis and proof of optimality.
For example, a restrictive time limit (set by the user with the <samp class="ph codeph">TiLim</samp> parameter)
may be in force due to a real-time application deployment, where a
model is of sufficient difficulty that a proof of optimality is unlikely,
and the user wants to have simply as good a solution as is practicable
when the time limit is reached. The <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp> setting
of <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> (<samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasisFeasibility</samp> 
in Concert Technology or <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_FEASIBILITY</samp> in
the Callable Library) directs CPLEX to adopt this emphasis. Less computational
effort is applied at the outset toward the analyses that aid in the
eventual proof of optimality, and more effort is spent in immediately
beginning computations that search for early (and then improved) feasible
solutions. It is likely on most models that an eventual proof of optimality
would take longer by setting <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp> to
1 , but since the user has given CPLEX the additional information
that this proof is of less importance than usual, the user's needs
will actually be met more effectively.</p>
<p class="p">Another choice for <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp> is <samp class="ph codeph">2</samp> (<samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasisOptimality</samp> in
Concert Technology or, in the Callable Library, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_OPTIMALITY</samp>).
This setting results in a greater emphasis on optimality than on feasibility.
The search for feasible solutions is not ignored completely, but the
balance is shifted toward moving the Best Bound (described in the
following paragraph) more rapidly, at the likely expense of feasible
solutions being found less rapidly, and improved feasible solutions
less frequently, than with the default emphasis.</p>
<p class="p">The fourth choice for <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">3</samp> (<samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasisBestBound</samp> in
Concert Technology or, in the Callable Library, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_BESTBOUND</samp>)
works exclusively at moving the <em class="ph i">Best
Bound</em>. The Best Bound represents the objective function
value at which an integer feasible solution could still potentially
exist. As possibilities are eliminated, this Best Bound value will
move in the opposite direction to that of any improving series of
integer feasible solutions. The process of moving the Best Bound will
eventually result in the optimal feasible solution being discovered,
at which point the optimization is complete, and feasible solutions
may be discovered along the way anyway, due to branches that happen
to locate feasible solutions that do not match the Best Bound. A great
deal of analysis may be performed on the model, beyond what is done
with the default emphasis. Therefore, it is recommended to use this
setting only on models that are difficult for the default emphasis,
and for which you do not care about interim feasible solutions that
may or may not be optimal.</p>
<p class="p">The final choice for <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp> is
4 (<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_MIPEMPHASIS_HIDDENFEAS</samp>). It applies
considerable additional effort toward finding high quality feasible
solutions that are difficult to locate, and for this reason the eventual
proof of optimality may take longer than with default settings. This
choice is intended for use on difficult models where a proof of optimality
is unlikely, and where emphasis 1 (one) does not deliver solutions
of an appropriately high quality. </p>
<p class="p">To make clear a point that has been alluded to so far:
every choice of <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp> results in
the search algorithm proceeding in a manner that eventually will find
and prove an optimal solution, or will prove that no integer feasible
solution exists. The choice of emphasis only guides CPLEX to produce
feasible solutions in a way that is in keeping with the user's particular
purposes, but the accuracy and completeness of the algorithm is not
sacrificed in the process.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp>  parameter
may be set in conjunction with any other CPLEX parameters (discussed
at length in the next section). For example, if you wish to set an
upward branching strategy via the <samp class="ph codeph">BrDir</samp> parameter,
this will be honored by any setting of <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp>.
Of course, certain combinations of <samp class="ph codeph">MIPEmphasis</samp> with
other parameters may be counter-productive, such as turning off all
cuts with emphasis <samp class="ph codeph">3</samp>, but the user has
the option if that is what is wanted.</p>
