<h1 class="title topictitle1">Slightly infeasible integer variables</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes remedies for slightly infeasible integer variables.</p>
<p class="p">On some models, the integer solution returned by CPLEX
at default settings may contain solution values for the discrete variables
that violate integrality by a small amount. The <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/EpInt.html" title="Specifies the amount by which an integer variable can be different from an integer and still be considered feasible.">integrality tolerance</a> parameter
(<samp class="ph codeph">EpInt</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_EPINT</samp>)
has a default value of 1e-5, which means that any discrete variable
that violates integrality by no more than this amount will not be
branched upon for resolution. For most model formulations, this situation
is satisfactory and avoids branching that may be essentially meaningless,
only consuming additional computing time. </p>
<p class="p">However, some formulations combine discrete and continuous
variables, for example, involving constraint coefficients over a million
in magnitude, where even a small integrality violation can be magnified
elsewhere in the model. In such situations, you may attempt to address
this variation by tightening the simplex <a class="xref" href="../../../../../Parameters/topics/EpRHS.html" title="Specifies the feasibility tolerance, that is, the degree to which the basic variables of a model may violate their bounds.">feasibility tolerance</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">EpRHS</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_EPRHS</samp>)
from its default value to its minimum; also tighten <samp class="ph codeph">EpInt</samp> to
a similar value, and re-run the MIP optimization from the beginning. </p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> <p class="p">If you restart CPLEX from a previously optimal or infeasible
solution and use reduced tolerance without making any other change
to the problem, the previous solution status remains valid. Consequently,
no iterations will occur because parameter settings (such as this
reduced tolerance) are part of the environment in which CPLEX operates,
rather than part of a solution to one of possibly multiple models
in that environment. In other words, changing parameters does not
alter the solution status, but changing the model does. You can make
CPLEX restart the optimization using new tolerances by making a superfluous
change in the model, for example, by resetting the bound on a variable
to its existing value.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">If this adjustment is insufficient to give satisfactory
results, you can also try setting <samp class="ph codeph">EpInt</samp> all
the way to zero, preferably in conjunction with a tightened <samp class="ph codeph">EpRHS</samp> 
setting. This very tight integrality tolerance directs CPLEX to attempt
to branch on any integer infeasibility, no matter how small. Numeric
round-off due to floating-point arithmetic on any computer may make
it impossible to achieve this tolerance, but in practice, the setting
achieves its aim in many models and reduces the integrality violations
in many others. In cases where the integrality violation even after
branching remains above <samp class="ph codeph">EpInt</samp>  or is above
1e-10 when <samp class="ph codeph">EpInt</samp>  has been set to a value
smaller than that, a solution status returned will be <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_STAT_OPTIMAL_INFEAS</samp> instead
of the usual <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_STAT_OPTIMAL</samp>. In most
cases a solution with status <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_STAT_OPTIMAL_INFEAS</samp> will
be satisfactory, and reflects only round-off error after presolve
uncrush, but extra care in using the solution may be advisable in
numerically sensitive formulations.</p>
<p class="p">If these suggestions are not appropriate for your problem,
another alternative to consider is reformulation of your model with
indicator constraints. <a class="xref" href="../../indicator_constr/01_indicators_title_synopsis.html" title="Introduces indicator constraints and emphasizes their advantages over Big M formulations.">Indicator constraints in optimization</a> offers more information about that alternative.</p>
