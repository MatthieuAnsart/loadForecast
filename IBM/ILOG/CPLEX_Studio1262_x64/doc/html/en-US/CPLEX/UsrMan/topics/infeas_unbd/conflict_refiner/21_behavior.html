<h1 class="title topictitle1">More about the conflict refiner</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the behavior of the conflict refiner in greater
detail.</p>
<p class="p">Presolve proved the infeasibility of that simplified
example in <a class="xref" href="08_eg_model.html" title="Describes a model to exercise the conflict refiner in the Interactive Optimizer.">A model for the conflict refiner</a>.
However, a minimal conflict can be refined from an infeasible model
regardless of how the infeasibility was found. The infeasibility may
have been proven by presolve, by the continuous optimizers, or by
the mixed integer optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">A minimal conflict on a nontrivial model can take longer
to refine than the associated optimization algorithm would have taken
either to prove the infeasibility or to solve a similar model instance
that was feasible. One reason that refining a minimal conflict may
take longer is that multiple passes (that is, iterations) are performed;
each iteration solves a submodel to decide its feasibility status.
Another reason is that even if the full model is quickly detected
to be infeasible, the infeasibility of the submodels may be less blatant
and thus require more time to analyze. It can happen that a number
of refinement iterations proceed quickly, and then suddenly no further
progress is seen for quite a long time. This deceptive appearance
of lack of progress may be especially noticeable in the case of mixed
integer models, where a proof of infeasibility may become a quite
difficult mathematical problem.</p>
<p class="p">If the user sets a resource limit, such as a time limit,
an iteration limit, or node limit, for example, or if a user interrupts
the process interactively, the conflict that is available at that
termination will be the best (that is, the most refined) that was
achievable at that point. Even a nonminimal conflict may be more useful
than the full model for discovering the cause of infeasibility. The
status of a bound or constraint in such a nonminimal conflict may
be <em class="ph i">proved</em>, meaning
that the conflict refiner had sufficient resources to prove participation
of bound or constraint in the conflict, or the status may be <em class="ph i">possible</em>, meaning that the conflict
refiner has not yet proven whether the bound or constraint is necessarily
part of a minimal conflict.</p>
<p class="p">If a model contains more than one cause of infeasibility,
then the conflict that is delivered may not be unique. As you saw
in the example, you may repair one infeasibility only to find that
there is another arising. An iterative approach may be necessary.</p>
<p class="p">When the conflict refiner is allowed to run to completion,
a conflict will be minimal in the sense that removal of any constraint
or bound will result in a feasible subproblem. However, even if there
is a single cause of infeasibility, it is worth realizing that conflicts
can often be derived in more than one way, and one minimal conflict
may be smaller (fewer in number of constraints or bounds) than another.
For example, consider this small set of inconsistent constraints:
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>x + y + z &gt;= 1
x         &lt;= 0
    y     &lt;= 0
        z &lt;= 0
x + y + z &lt;= 0</code></pre>
<p class="p">There are multiple minimal conflicts in that small set.
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>(1)
x + y + z &gt;= 1
x         &lt;= 0
    y     &lt;= 0
        z &lt;= 0</code></pre>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>(2)
x + y + z &gt;= 1
x + y + z &lt;= 0</code></pre>
<p class="p">Removing any one of the constraints in conflict (1) results
in feasibility. Likewise, removing either of the constraints in conflict
(2) also results in feasibility. Either representation may guide you
toward a correct analysis of the infeasibilities in the model.</p>
<p class="p">Keep in mind also that a conflict may guide you toward
multiple ways to repair a model, some more reasonable than others.
For example, if the conflict in a model using continuous variables
to represent percentages looked like this:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>x1 + x2 + x3 &gt;= 400
Bounds
0 &lt;= x1 &lt;= 100
0 &lt;= x2 &lt;= 100
0 &lt;= x3 &lt;= 100</code></pre>
<p class="p">the infeasibility could be repaired by one change, namely,
by increasing the upper bound of <samp class="ph codeph">x3</samp>  to
be 200. However, with the way the variables are defined, this modification
makes little sense. It is more likely that the model contains a subtle
mistake in modeling (if the constraint should include more than three
variables, for example).</p>
<p class="p">When the model passed to the conflict refiner is actually
feasible, the conflict refiner will return this message:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Problem is feasible; no conflict available</code></pre>
<p class="p">An attempt to display or access a conflict when none
exists, whether because the conflict refiner has not yet been invoked
or because an error occurred, results in this error message:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>No conflict exists.</code></pre>
<p class="p">The cause of those messages will usually be apparent
to a user. However, numeric instability may cause genuine uncertainty
for a user. In an unstable model, one of the optimizers may return
a valid conclusion of infeasibility, based on the numeric precision
allowed by the model, and yet when a trivial modification is made,
the model status changes, and a feasible solution now seems attainable.
Because one of the conventional signs of instability can be this switching
back and forth from feasibility to infeasibility, the user should
be alert to this possibility. The conflict refiner halts and returns
an error code if an infeasible model suddenly appears feasible during
its analysis, due to this presumption of numeric instability. The
user should turn attention away from infeasibility analysis at that
point, and toward the sections in this manual such as <a class="xref" href="../../cont_optim/simplex/20_num_difficulty.html" title="Documents CPLEX behavior with respect to numeric difficulties in LP models.">Numeric difficulties</a>.</p>
