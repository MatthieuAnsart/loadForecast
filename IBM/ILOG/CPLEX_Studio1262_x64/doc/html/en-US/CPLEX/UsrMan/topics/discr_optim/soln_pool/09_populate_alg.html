<h1 class="title topictitle1">Algorithm of the populate procedure</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the algorithm of the populate procedure.</p>
<p class="p">Briefly, the algorithm that populates the solution pool
works in two phases.</p>
<p class="p">In the first phase, it solves the model to optimality
(or some stopping criterion set by the user), but it retains nodes
that might contain useful, even if not necessarily optimal integer
feasible solutions—nodes that would be pruned by the optimality
based branch-and-cut algorithm of CPLEX. In other words, it retains
nodes that have a feasible relaxation but an objective value worse
than the cutoff value, as well as nodes that have an integer feasible
relaxation solution without all the integer restricted variables having
fixed bounds.</p>
<p class="p">In the second phase, it generates multiple solutions
by using the information computed and stored in the first phase and
by continuing to explore the tree. Specifically, it branches on the
additional nodes retained in the first phase and continues to explore
the subtrees associated with these nodes.</p>
<p class="p">The amount of preparation in the first phase and the
intensity of exploration in the second phase are controlled by the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/SolnPoolIntensity.html" title="Controls the trade-off between the number of solutions generated for the solution pool and the amount of time or memory consumed.">solution pool intensity</a> parameter:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">SolnPoolIntensity</samp> in
Concert Technology; </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_SOLNPOOLINTENSITY</samp> in
the Callable Library;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">mip pool intensity</samp> 
 in the Interactive Optimizer. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">After a model has been read (or created), the first call
to populate will carry out both the first and second phase. In the
general case, subsequent calls to populate will re-use stored information
and proceed with the continuation of the second phase. The first phase
will be re-computed if:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">the value of the pool intensity parameter
has increased between successive calls of populate;</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">any filters have been deleted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The details of the algorithm that populates the solution
pool are published in the paper titled "Generating Multiple Solutions
for Mixed Integer Programming Problems," by Emilie Danna, Mary Fenelon,
Zonghao Gu, and Roland Wunderling, in the <strong class="ph b">Proceedings
of the Twelfth Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial
Optimization</strong> (<strong class="ph b">IPCO 2007</strong>),
 LNCS 4513, pages 280 - 294. </p>
