<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes RINS as a heuristic of the MIP optimizer.</p>
<p class="p">Relaxation induced neighborhood search (RINS) is a heuristic
that explores a neighborhood of the current incumbent solution to
try to find a new, improved incumbent. The neighborood depends 
on the current incumbent solution, as well as on the
the current fractional solution of a branch-and-cut node.
The neighborhood is formulated and explored as another MIP 
(known as the subMIP). The subMIP optimization is truncated 
by limiting the number of nodes explored in the search tree.</p>
<p class="p">Two parameters apply specifically to RINS: <samp class="ph codeph">RINSHeur</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">SubMIPNodeLim</samp>.</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">RINSHeur</samp> controls how often
RINS is invoked, in a manner analogous to the way that <samp class="ph codeph">HeurFreq</samp> works.
 A setting of 100, for example, means that RINS is invoked every 100th
node in the tree, while -1 turns it off. The default setting is 0
(zero), which means that CPLEX decides when to apply it; with this
automatic setting, RINS is applied very much less frequently than
the node heuristic is applied because RINS typically consumes more
time.   Also, with the default setting, RINS is turned entirely off
if the node heuristic has been turned off via a <samp class="ph codeph">HeurFreq</samp> 
setting of -1; with any other <samp class="ph codeph">RINSHeur</samp> setting
than 0 (zero), the <samp class="ph codeph">HeurFreq</samp> setting
does not affect RINS frequency.</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">SubMIPNodeLim</samp> restricts the
number of nodes searched in the subMIP during application of the relaxation
induced neighborhood search (RINS) heuristic. Its default is 500 is
satisfactory in most situations, but you can set this parameter to
any positive integer if you need to tune performance for your problem.</p>
<p class="p">For more about this heuristic, see the article published
by Emilie Danna, Edward Rothberg, Claude Le Pape in 2005, titled <em class="ph i">Exploring relaxation induced neighborhoods to improve
MIP solutions</em> in the journal <strong class="ph b">Mathematical
Programming</strong> in volume 102, issue 1, pages 71–90.</p>
