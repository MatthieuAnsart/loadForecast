<h1 class="title topictitle1">Discontinuous piecewise linear functions</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Defines a discontinuous piecewise linear function.</p>
<p class="p">Thus far, you have seen a piecewise linear function where
the segments are continuous. Intuitively, in a continuous piecewise
linear function, the endpoint of one segment has the same coordinates
as the initial point of the next segment, as in <a class="xref" href="02_pwl_defn.html#User_manual.uss_usingPiecewiseLin.1003384__User_manual.uss_usingPiecewiseLin.1003400">Figure 1</a>. One way of defining a continuous piecewise linear
function is by specifying its breakpoints and the slope of each segment.
Those specification breakpoints are also known as the <strong class="ph b">anchors</strong> of
their segments.</p>
<p class="p">There are piecewise linear functions, however, where the
endpoint of one segment and the initial point of the next segment
may have the same <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp> coordinate but differ
in the value of <samp class="ph codeph">f(x)</samp>. Such a difference
is known as a <strong class="ph b">step</strong> in the piecewise linear function,
and such a function is known as <strong class="ph b">discontinuous</strong>. <a class="xref" href="04_discontinuous.html#User_manual.uss_usingPiecewiseLin.1003373__User_manual.uss_usingPiecewiseLin.1008156">Figure 1</a> shows a discontinuous piecewise linear function with
two steps.</p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span>  <p class="p">When the <strong class="ph b">anchor</strong> of
a segment resides at a <strong class="ph b">step</strong>, then the discontinuous
piecewise linear function is <strong class="ph b">not</strong> uniquely defined
by specifying its breakpoints and the slopes of its segments. In contrast,
as long as the anchor point resides elsewhere, rather than at a step,
one can specify a discontinuous piecewise linear function by its breakpoints
and slopes as one specifies a continuous piecewise linear function.</p>
 </div>
<p class="p">Syntactically, a step is represented in this way:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The x-coordinate of the breakpoint where
the step occurs is repeated in the array of the breakpoint.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The value of the first point of a step in
the array of slopes is the height of the step. This value replaces
the undefined slope of the vertical line associated with the discontinuous
step.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The value of the second point of the step
in the array of slopes is the slope of the function after the step.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Concert Technology also supports discontinuous piecewise
linear functions specified by the x-coordinate of the breakpoints
and their associated function values, along with the  slopes of the
first and last segments. This additional information uniquely defines
the function. At a step, the value of the x-coordinate appears twice
in the breakpoint array of the specification. The function values
associated with the bottom and top of the step appear in the corresponding
entries of the values array.</p>
<p class="p">By convention, a breakpoint belongs in both segments associated
with the step. For example, in <a class="xref" href="04_discontinuous.html#User_manual.uss_usingPiecewiseLin.1003373__User_manual.uss_usingPiecewiseLin.1008156">Figure 1</a>, at the breakpoint <samp class="ph codeph">x=3</samp> ,
the points <samp class="ph codeph">(3,1)</samp>  and <samp class="ph codeph">(3,3)</samp> are
both admissible. Similarly, when <samp class="ph codeph">x = 5</samp> ,
the points <samp class="ph codeph">(5,4)</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">(5,5)</samp> are
both admissible.</p>
<p class="p">However, isolated points, as explained in <a class="xref" href="05_isolated_pts.html" title="Defines an isolated point in a piecewise linear function.">Isolated points in piecewise linear functions</a>, are not allowed,
neither in continuous nor in discontinuous piecewise linear functions.
In fact, only one step is allowed at a given point.</p>
<p class="p">In Concert Technology, a discontinuous piecewise linear
function is represented by the overloaded function<samp class="ph codeph">IloPiecewiseLinear</samp>.
For example, the function in <a class="xref" href="04_discontinuous.html#User_manual.uss_usingPiecewiseLin.1003373__User_manual.uss_usingPiecewiseLin.1008156">Figure 1</a> is declared in this way, with the discontinuous step
values (2 and 1) highlighted:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloPiecewiseLinear(x, 
                   IloNumArray(env, 4, 3. ,3. ,5. ,5.),
                   IloNumArray(env, 5, 0., <strong class="ph b">2</strong>., 0.5, <strong class="ph b">1.</strong>, -1.),
                   0, 1);</code></pre>
<p class="p">The anchor point of (0,1) specified as the last two arguments
does not reside at a discontinuity in that example.</p>
<p class="p">Similarly, one can specify the same discontinuous piecewise
linear function using breakpoints and values  by providing the slope
of the segment preceding the first break point, arrays of the breakpoints
and associated function values, and the slope of the segment following
the last breakpoint, like this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>IloPiecewiseLinear(x, 0., 
                   IloNumArray(env, 4, 3. ,3. ,5. ,5.), 
                   IloNumArray(env, 4, 1., 3., 4., 5.), 
                   -1.); </code></pre>

A discontinuous piecewise linear function with steps</span><div class="image"><img class="image" src="../../../images/usingPiecewiseLin2.gif" alt="usingPiecewiseLin2.gif" /></div></div>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  <p class="p">It may help to understand the signature
of the function in this example to recall that in Cartesian coordinates,
the slope of a horizontal line (that is, a line or segment parallel
to the x-axis) is 0 (zero), and the slope of a vertical line (that
is, a line or segment parallel to the y-axis) is undefined in the
conventional representation: </p>
 <p class="p">y = ax + b </p>
 <p class="p">In the signature of the function, the undefined slope of
the vertical segment at the point of discontinuity is represented
as the height of the step. </p>
