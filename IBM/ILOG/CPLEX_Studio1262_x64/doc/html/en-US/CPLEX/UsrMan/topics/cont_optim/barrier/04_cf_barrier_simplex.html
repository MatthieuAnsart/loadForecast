<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Contrasts barrier optimizer with simplex optimizers.</p>
<p class="p">The barrier optimizer and the simplex optimizers (primal
and dual) are fundamentally different approaches to solving linear
programming problems. The key differences between them have these
implications:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Simplex and barrier optimizers differ
with respect to the nature of solutions. Barrier solutions tend to
be midface solutions. In cases where multiple optima exist, barrier
solutions tend to place the variables at values between their bounds,
whereas in basic solutions from a simplex technique, the values of
the variables are more likely to be at either their upper or their
lower bound. While objective values will be the same, the nature of
the solutions can be very different.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">By default, the barrier optimizer uses
crossover to produce a basis. However, you may choose to run the barrier
optimizer without crossover. In such a case, the fact that barrier
without crossover does not produce a basic solution has consequences.
Without a basis, you will not be able to optimize the same or similar
problems repeatedly using advanced start information. You will also
not be able to obtain range information for performing sensitivity
analysis.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Simplex and barrier optimizers have
different numeric properties, sensitivity, and behavior. For example,
the barrier optimizer is sensitive to the presence of unbounded optimal
faces, whereas the simplex optimizers are not. As a result, problems
that are numerically difficult for one method may be easier to solve
by the other. In these cases, concurrent optimization, as documented
in <a class="xref" href="../../parallel_optim/multi_threaded_parallel/11_concurrent.html" title="Describes the concurrent optimizer.">Concurrent optimizer in parallel</a>,
may be helpful.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Simplex and barrier optimizers have
different memory requirements. Depending on the size of the Cholesky
factor, the barrier optimizer can require significantly more memory
than the simplex optimizers.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Simplex and barrier optimizers work
well on different types of problems. The barrier optimizer works well
on problems where the AA<sup class="ph sup">T</sup> remains
sparse. Also, highly degenerate problems that pose difficulties for
the primal or dual simplex optimizers may be solved quickly by the
barrier optimizer. In contrast, the simplex optimizers will probably
perform better on problems where the AA<sup class="ph sup">T</sup> and
the resulting Cholesky factor are relatively dense, though it is sometimes
difficult to predict from the dimensions of the model when this will
be the case. Again, concurrent optimization, as documented in 
<a class="xref" href="../../parallel_optim/multi_threaded_parallel/11_concurrent.html" title="Describes the concurrent optimizer.">Concurrent optimizer in parallel</a>,
may be helpful.</p>
