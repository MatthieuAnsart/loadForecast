<h1 class="title topictitle1">Using a file of Interactive Optimizer commands from
your operating system</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The Interactive Optimizer accepts a file from
your operating system.</p>
<p class="p">You can create a file of Interactive Optimizer commands
to use from your operating system.  CPLEX accepts this file and executes
the commands in a session of the Interactive Optimizer. This strategy
can be helpful on an operating system, such as IBM Blue Gene, where
it is not appropriate to redirect one command to another. The strategy
is also available on other operating systems, such as  Microsoft Windows,
GNU/Linux, or IBM z/OS. </p>
<p class="p"> To use this feature of the Interactive Optimizer, first
create the file  as you normally create a new file on your operating
system. Put each Interactive Optimizer command on a separate line
in the file,  as you would type commands to enter in the Interactive
Optimizer. </p>
<p class="p"> To invoke your file of commands, use the following syntax
at the  command line of your operating system, where <samp class="ph codeph">cplex</samp> is
the command  to invoke the Interactive Optimizer, <samp class="ph codeph">-f</samp> is
the option to specify a filename,  and <em class="ph i">filename</em> is the name
of your file:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cplex -f filename</code></pre>
<p class="p">If the name of the file containing commands includes spaces, be sure to 
enclose the name of the file in double quotation marks when you pass it to 
the <samp class="ph codeph">-f</samp> option. This technique of quoting file names that include 
spaces works for the command-line option; however, the <samp class="ph codeph">read</samp> command 
inside the Interactive Optimizer does not recognize file names including spaces, 
even when the file names are quoted.</p>
<p class="p">In fact, if you enclose each of the commands separately in double quotation marks, 
you are not obliged to collect them in a file. You can simply pass a series of commands 
(each enclosed in double quotation marks) 
to the Interactive Optimizer on the command line of your operating system, like this example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>cplex -c "read <em class="ph i">a_problem_name.lp</em>" "opt" "disp sol var -" "quit"</code></pre>
<p class="p">In that example, <em class="ph i">a_problem_name</em> represents the name of a file containing a formatted 
model and data, <samp class="ph codeph">opt</samp> is the acceptable abbreviation of the command to optimize
the input, and <samp class="ph codeph">disp sol var - </samp> tells CPLEX to display the variables of the solution.</p>
