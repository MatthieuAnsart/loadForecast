<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX supports the SAV binary file format for numerical accuracy in 
reading and writing problems.</p>
<p class="p">SAV is a binary file format specific to CPLEX. This format is efficient 
for fast reading and writing of models and associated basis information. 
For example, it can effectively reduce read and write time for problems 
that are solved repetitively.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tip:</strong> CPLEX includes the basis in a SAV file only if the problem currently in 
memory has been optimized and a basis exists.</p>
<p class="p">This format also offers the advantage of being numerically accurate 
(to the same degree as your platform) in contrast to text file formats 
that may lose numerical accuracy. In other words, it provides a greater 
degree of precision in data. However, since a SAV file is binary, 
you cannot read nor edit it with your favorite text editor.</p>
<p class="p">These other, more specialized file formats are based on the SAV file format:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">DPE</strong> is the format CPLEX uses to write a problem in a 
binary SAV file after the objective function of the problem has been perturbed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">PPE</strong> is the format CPLEX uses to write a problem 
in a binary SAV file after the righthand side (RHS) has been perturbed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">PRE</strong> is the format CPLEX uses to write a presolved, 
reduced problem formulation to a binary SAV file. 
Since a presolved problem has been reduced, it does not correspond 
to the original problem.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The topic <a class="xref" href="InteractiveOptimizer_save.html" title="CPLEX offers several file formats to save a problem in the Interactive Optimizer.">Saving problems in the Interactive Optimizer</a> 
explains how to use the SAV file format in the Interactive Optimizer. </p>
