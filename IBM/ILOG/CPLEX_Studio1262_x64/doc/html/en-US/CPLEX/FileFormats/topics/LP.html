<body role="main" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">LP file format: algebraic representation</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX conforms to these rules for the LP file format.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX provides a facility for entering a problem in a
natural, algebraic LP formulation from the keyboard. The problem can
be modified and saved from within CPLEX. This procedure is one way
to create a file in a format that  CPLEX can read. An alternative
technique is to create a similar file using a standard text editor
and to read it into CPLEX.</p>
<p class="p">The CPLEX LP format is provided as an input alternative
to the MPS file format. An LP format file may be easier to generate
than an MPS file if your problem already exists in an algebraic format
or if you have an application which generates the problem file more
readily in algebraic format (such as a C application). <a class="xref" href="../../UsrMan/topics/progr_consid/input_output/manageIO_file_formats_LP.html" title="Describes programming considerations for working with LP file format.">Working with LP files</a> in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX
User’s Manual</em> in the chapter about managing input and output explains
the implications of using LP format rather than MPS format.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX accepts any problem saved in an ASCII file provided
that it adheres to the following syntax rules.</p>
<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177161"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Comments</h2><p class="p">Anything that
follows a backslash (\) is a comment and is ignored until a return
is encountered. Blank lines are also ignored. Blank lines and comment
lines may be placed anywhere and as frequently as you want in the
file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177168"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">White space and line length</h2><p class="p">In
general, white space between characters is irrelevant as it is skipped
when a file is read. However, white space is not allowed in the keywords
used to introduce a new section, such as <samp class="ph codeph">MAX</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">MIN</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">ST</samp> , or <samp class="ph codeph">BOUNDS</samp> . Also the keywords must be separated by
white space from the rest of the file and must be at the beginning
of a line. The maximum length for any name is 255. The maximum length
of any line of input is 560.</p>
<p class="p">Skipping spaces may cause
CPLEX to misinterpret (and accept) an invalid entry, such as the following:
 </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> x1 x2 = 0</code></pre>
<p class="p">If the user intended to enter that example
as a nonlinear constraint, CPLEX would instead interpret it as a constraint
specifying that one variable named <samp class="ph codeph">x1x2</samp> must
be equal to zero. </p>
<p class="p">To indicate a quadratic constraint
in this section, use explicit notation for multiplication and exponentiation
(not space).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177178"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Problem sense</h2><p class="p">The problem
statement must begin with the word <samp class="ph codeph">MINIMIZE</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">MAXIMIZE</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">MINIMUM</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">MAXIMUM</samp>, or the abbreviations <samp class="ph codeph">MIN</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">MAX</samp> , in any combination of upper- and lowercase
characters. The word introduces the objective function section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177185"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Variables</h2><p class="p">Variables can
be named anything provided that the name does not exceed 255 characters,
all of which must be alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) or one of these
symbols: ! " # $ % &amp; ( ) , . ; ? @ _ ‘ ’ { } ~. Longer names are
truncated to 255 characters. A variable name can not begin with a
number or a period. </p>
<p class="p">The letter <samp class="ph codeph">E</samp> 
or <samp class="ph codeph">e</samp> , alone or followed by other valid
symbols, or followed by another <samp class="ph codeph">E</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">e</samp> , should be avoided as this notation is reserved
for exponential entries. Thus, variables can not be named <samp class="ph codeph">e9</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">E-24</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">E8cats</samp> ,
or other names that could be interpreted as an exponent. Even variable
names such as <samp class="ph codeph">eels</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">example</samp> 
can cause a read error, depending on their placement in an input line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177192"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Objective function</h2><p class="p">The
objective function definition must follow <samp class="ph codeph">MINIMIZE</samp> 
or <samp class="ph codeph">MAXIMIZE</samp> . It may be entered on multiple
lines as long as no variable, constant, or sense indicator is split
by a return. For example, this objective function <samp class="ph codeph">1x1 + 2x2 +3x3</samp> 
can be entered like this:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>1x1 + 2x2
+ 3x3</code></pre>
<p class="p">but not like this:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>1x1 + 2x
2 + 3x3         \ a bad idea</code></pre>
<p class="p">because the second style splits the variable
name <samp class="ph codeph">x2</samp>  with a return.</p>
<p class="p">The
objective function may be named by typing a name and a colon before
the objective function. The objective function name and the colon
must appear on the same line. Objective function names must conform
to the same guidelines as variable names. (See the rule about 
<a class="xref" href="LP.html#File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177185">Variables</a>). 
If no objective function name is specified, CPLEX
assigns the name <samp class="ph codeph">obj</samp> .</p>
<p class="p">An
objective function may be quadratic. For an example and details about
formatting a quadratic objective function, see the rule about 
<a class="xref" href="LP.html#File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177305">Quadratic terms</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Objective offset</h2>
<div class="p">You can optionally include an 
objective offset as a final constant term in the objective function.
For example, the following line declares an objective offset of 3.1415. 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>obj:  x1 + 2 x2 + 3.1415</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="p">Likewise, the objective offset follows any quadratic expressions in LP 
 file format of a quadratic program, like the following line:
 <pre class="pre codeblock"><code> obj: x + 2 y + [ x ^2 - 3 x * y ] / 2 + 3.1415
 </code></pre>

 </div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177204"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Constraints</h2><p class="p">The constraints
section is introduced by the keyword <samp class="ph codeph">subject to</samp> .
This expression can also appear as <samp class="ph codeph">such that</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">st</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">S.T.</samp> , or <samp class="ph codeph">ST.</samp>  in any mix of upper- and lowercase characters.
One of these expressions must precede the first constraint and be
separated from it by at least one space.</p>
<p class="p">Each constraint
definition must begin on a new line. A constraint may be named by
typing a name and a colon before the constraint. The constraint name
and the colon must appear on the same line. Constraint names must
adhere to the same guidelines as variable names. (See the rule about
names of <a class="xref" href="LP.html#File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177185">Variables</a>.) If no constraint names are specified, CPLEX assigns
the names <samp class="ph codeph">c1</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">c2</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">c3</samp>, etc.</p>
<p class="p">The constraints are entered
in the same way as the objective function; however, a constraint must
be followed by an indication of its sense and a righthand side coefficient.
The righthand side coefficient must be typed on the same line as the
sense indicator. Acceptable sense indicators are &lt;, &lt;=, =&lt;, &gt;, &gt;=,
=&gt;, and =. These are interpreted as ≤, ≤, ≤, ≥, ≥, ≥, and =, respectively. </p>
<p class="p">For example, here is a named constraint:  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>time: x1 + x2 &lt;= 10</code></pre>
<p class="p">Quadratic constraints are allowed in this
section. Quadratic terms are specified inside square brackets<samp class="ph codeph"> []</samp>  as detailed in the rule about <a class="xref" href="LP.html#File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177305">Quadratic terms</a>. The specification of a quadratic constraint differs
from the specification of a quadratic objective in one important way:
in a quadratic constraint, the terms are not divided by two; that
is, they are not multiplied by 1/2, as they must be in a quadratic
objective.</p>
<p class="p">Indicator constraints are also allowed in
this section. The rule about <a class="xref" href="LP.html#File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177287">MIP indicator constraints</a> explains how to specify indicator constraints.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177208"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Bounds</h2>
<p class="p">The optional <samp class="ph codeph">bounds</samp>  section follows the mandatory constraint
section. It is preceded by the word <samp class="ph codeph">bounds</samp> 
or <samp class="ph codeph">bound</samp>  in any mix of lower- and uppercase
characters.</p>
<p class="p">Each bound definition must begin on a new
line. The format for a bound is l<sub class="ph sub">n</sub> <sub class="ph sub"> </sub>≤x<sub class="ph sub">n</sub>≤ u<sub class="ph sub">n</sub> except in the following cases.</p>
<p class="p">Upper and lower bounds may also be entered separately as </p>
<p class="p">l<sub class="ph sub">n</sub> ≤x<sub class="ph sub">n</sub> </p>
<p class="p">x<sub class="ph sub">n </sub>≤ u<sub class="ph sub">n</sub> </p>
<p class="p">with the
default lower bound of 0 (zero) and the default upper bound of +∞
remaining in effect until the bound is explicitly changed.</p>
<p class="p">Bounds that fix a variable can be entered as simple equalities.
For example, <samp class="ph codeph">x5 = 5.6</samp>  is equivalent to <samp class="ph codeph">5.6 &lt;= x5 &lt;= 5.6</samp> .</p>
<p class="p">The bounds
+∞ (positive infinity) and -∞ (negative infinity) must be entered
as words: <samp class="ph codeph">+infinity</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">-infinity</samp> ,<samp class="ph codeph"> +inf</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">-inf</samp> .</p>
<p class="p">A variable with a negative infinity lower bound and positive
infinity upper bound may be entered as <samp class="ph codeph">free</samp> ,
in any mix of upper- and lowercase characters, with a space separating
the variable name and the word <samp class="ph codeph">free</samp> . For
example, <samp class="ph codeph">x7 free</samp>  is equivalent to <samp class="ph codeph">- infinity &lt;= x7 &lt;= + infinity</samp> .</p>
<p class="p">The
last bound entered takes precedence over previously entered bounds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Arrays of variables</h2>
<p class="p">When CPLEX translates your algebraic model to the LP format, 
it must transform all multi-dimenational arrays of variables into scalar variables. 
This transformation assigns a different name to each element of each such array. 
In renaming the elements of arrays of variables, CPLEX does not simply concatenate
the indices of an element to approximate a new multi-digit index because 
simply concatenating the indices of elements as they are does not rename the elements unambiguously.
For example, consider a two-dimensional array named myarray with elements such as
myarray[1][23] and myarray[12][3].  Simple concatenation produces one ambiguous name, myarray[123],
for both of those distinct elements. Consequently, to avoid such ambiguity in renaming 
the elements of a multi-dimensional array of variables, the transformation to LP format 
introduces a separator (#). In this example, myarray[1][23] is renamed as myarray#1#23 and
myarray[12][3] is renamed as myarray#12#3.</p>

<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177257"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">End of file</h2><p class="p">The file must
end with the word <samp class="ph codeph">end</samp>  in any combination
of upper- and lowercase characters, alone on a line, when it is created
with the <samp class="ph codeph">enter</samp>  command. This word is not
required for files that are read in to CPLEX, but it is a good practice
to use it. Files that have been corrupted can frequently be detected
by a missing last line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177264"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MIP integer variables</h2><p class="p">This rule applies to the CPLEX MIP optimizer. </p>
<p class="p">To
specify any of the variables as general integer variables, add a <samp class="ph codeph">GENERAL</samp>  section; to specify any of the variables
as binary integer variables, add a <samp class="ph codeph">BINARY</samp> 
section. The <samp class="ph codeph">GENERAL</samp>  and <samp class="ph codeph">BINARY</samp> 
sections follow the <samp class="ph codeph">BOUNDS</samp>  section, if
one is present; otherwise, they follow the constraints section. Either
of the <samp class="ph codeph">GENERAL</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">BINARY</samp> 
sections can precede the other. The <samp class="ph codeph">GENERAL</samp> 
section is preceded by the word <samp class="ph codeph">GENERAL</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">GENERALS</samp> , or <samp class="ph codeph">GEN</samp>  in
any mix of upper- and lowercase characters which must appear alone
on a line. The following line or lines should list the names of all
variables which are to be restricted to general integer values, separated
by at least one space. The <samp class="ph codeph">BINARY</samp>  section
is preceded by the word <samp class="ph codeph">BINARY</samp> , <samp class="ph codeph">BINARIES</samp> , or <samp class="ph codeph">BIN</samp>  in
any mix of upper- and lowercase characters which must appear alone
on a line. The following line or lines should list the names of all
variables which are to be restricted to binary integer values, separated
by at least one space. Binary variables are automatically given bounds
of 0 (zero) and 1 (one), unless alternative bounds are specified in
the <samp class="ph codeph">BOUNDS</samp>  section, in which case a warning
message is issued.</p>
<p class="p">Here is an example of a problem

<p class="p">To specify any of the variables

<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177280"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MIP special ordered sets</h2>
<p class="p">This rule applies to the CPLEX MIP optimizer. To specify
special ordered sets, use an SOS section, which is preceded by the
SOS keyword. The SOS section should follow the Bounds, General, Binaries
and Semi-Continuous sections. Special ordered sets of type 1 require
that, of the variables in the set, one at most may be nonzero. Special
ordered sets of type 2 require that at most two variables in the set
may be nonzero, and if there are two nonzeros, they must be adjacent.
Adjacency is defined by the weights, which must be unique within a
set given to the variables. The sorted weights define the order of
the special ordered set. For MIP branch and cut, the order is used
to decide how the variables are branched upon. See the <em class="ph i">CPLEX
User’s Manual</em> for more information. The set is specified by an
optional set name followed by a colon and then either of the S1 or
S2 keywords (specifying the type) followed by a double colon. The
set member names are listed on this line or lines, with their weights.
Variable names and weights are separated by a colon, for example:</p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">SOS</samp> </p>
<p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">  set1: S1::  x1:10  x2:13</samp> </p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>[constraintname:]  binaryvariable = value  -&gt;  linear constraint</code></pre>
<p class="p">The constraint name, followed by a colon,
is optional. The hyphen followed by the greater-than symbol (<samp class="ph codeph">-&gt;</samp>), separates the indicator variable and its

<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177305"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Quadratic terms</h2><p class="p">This rule applies to applications that solve problems with
quadratic terms in them, that is, quadratic programming problems and
quadratically constrained programs (QPs and QCPs). Quadratic coefficients
may appear in the objective function. Quadratic coefficients may also
appear in constraints under certain conditions. If there are quadratically
constrained variables in the problem, see also rules about <a class="xref" href="LP.html#File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177185">Variables</a>, <a class="xref" href="LP.html#File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.162381__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.177204">Constraints</a>, and <a class="xref" href="../../UsrMan/topics/cont_optim/qcp/01_QCP_title_synopsis.html" title="Documents the solution of quadratically constrained programming problems (QCPs), including the special case of second order cone programming problems (SOCPs).">Solving problems with quadratic constraints (QCP)</a> in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX
User’s Manual</em>.</p>
<p class="p">The algebraic coefficients of the
function x'Qx are specified inside square brackets<samp class="ph codeph"> []</samp> .
The square brackets must be followed by a divide sign followed by
the number 2. This convention denotes that all coefficients inside
the square brackets will be divided by 2 in evaluating the quadratic
terms of the objective function. All quadratic coefficients must appear
inside square brackets. Multiple square bracket sections may be specified.</p>
<p class="p">Inside of the square brackets, two variables are multiplied
by an asterisk (<samp class="ph codeph">*</samp>). For example, <samp class="ph codeph">[4x*y]</samp> indicates that the coefficients of both of
the off-diagonal terms of Q, corresponding to the variables <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp>  and <samp class="ph codeph">y</samp>  in the model
are 2, since <samp class="ph codeph">4x*y</samp>  equals <samp class="ph codeph">2x*y + 2x*y</samp>.
Each pair of off-diagonal terms of Q is specified only once. CPLEX
automatically creates both off-diagonal entries of Q. Diagonal terms
in Q (that is, terms with an exponent of 2) are indicated by the caret
(<samp class="ph codeph">^</samp> ) followed by 2. For example, <samp class="ph codeph">4x^2</samp> indicates that the coefficient of the diagonal
term of Q corresponding to the variable <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp> in
the model is 4.</p>
<p class="p">For example, this problem</p>
