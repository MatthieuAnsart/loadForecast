<h1 class="title topictitle1">Special ordered sets (SOS) in MPS files</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The CPLEX extensions of MPS file format support special
ordered sets (SOSs).</p>
<p class="p">If you use the CPLEX mixed
integer optimizer (that is, the MIP optimizer), then you may define
special ordered sets (SOS) in MPS format.</p>
<p class="p">The convention for SOS uses set declaration lines and
member declaration lines, both of which begin in column 2 or
beyond. In a set declaration line, columns 2 and 3 specify S1
or S2. Optionally, the name of a set is specified in column 4.
In a member declaration line, column 5 or beyond specifies a variable
name. Note that in an MPS file, the SOS section must follow the BOUNDS
section.</p>
<p class="p">If weighting information is provided, it follows the
member name in a member declaration line.</p>
<p class="p">In the following example, an SOS section is placed after
the BOUNDS section: </p>

<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.156747__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.156821"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">'MARKER' lines for SOS in MPS files</h2><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">'MARKER'</samp>  lines are used
to delimit SOS in the <samp class="ph codeph">COLUMNS</samp>  section
of an MPS file, much like using integer markers. (The single quotation
mark before and after the term is necessary.) The names of the sets
are specified in the second field, starting in column 4 or beyond.
Names of sets must be unique. The <samp class="ph codeph">'MARKER'</samp> 
lines must come in pairs of an <samp class="ph codeph">'SOSORG'</samp> 
and <samp class="ph codeph">'SOSEND</samp> ' surrounding the columns that
are in the SOS. Optionally, in Field 1 of a <samp class="ph codeph">'MARKER' . . . 'SOSORG'</samp> 
line, either S1 or S2 may be specified to indicate the type of the
SOS. An SOS<samp class="ph codeph"> 'MARKER'</samp>  line without an S1
or S2 indicator is assumed to denote an S1 set. Members of an
SOS may or may not be integer or binary variables.</p>
<p class="p">There is no requirement that there be a constraint that
all members of an SOS sum to 1.0 (nor is any such constraint implicit).
However, providing such a constraint in your formulation may be desirable
as it may strengthen the LP relaxation of the mixed integer problem,
as for example in the case of an S1 set consisting of binary variables.</p>
<p class="p">In the following example, the excerpt from the COLUMNS
section of an MPS file defines an SOS Type 1 set consisting of <samp class="ph codeph">x5</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">x6</samp>.
which may be continuous or integer variables.  </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code> S1 NAME1     ‘MARKER’                 ‘SOSORG’
    x5        obj               -9     c1     5
    x5        c2                3
    x6        obj               -6     c1      8
    x6        c3                -4.5
    NAME1     ‘MARKER’                 ‘SOSEND’</code></pre>
<p class="p">The SOS <samp class="ph codeph">'MARKER'</samp>  lines can
appear between integer <samp class="ph codeph">'MARKER'</samp>  lines
(if all members of the SOS are integer), or integer <samp class="ph codeph">'MARKER'</samp> 
lines can appear between SOS <samp class="ph codeph">'MARKER' </samp> lines
(if some members of the SOS are non-integer).</p>
<p class="p">The MARKER format cannot accommodate overlapping SOSs.
That is, a variable cannot be a member of two special ordered sets.
Overlapping SOSs can, however, be specified by the CPLEX SOS format, documented
in <a class="xref" href="MPS_ext_sos.html" title="The CPLEX extensions of MPS file format support special ordered sets (SOSs).">Special ordered sets (SOS) in MPS files</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.156747__File_formats_reference.uss_reffileformatscplex.172622"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">REFROW section for SOS in MPS files</h2><p class="p">A <samp class="ph codeph">REFROW</samp>  section may be included
immediately before the <samp class="ph codeph">ROWS</samp>  section. It
consists of exactly one record line with the name of the reference
row starting in Field 2. The specified row must also be defined in
the <samp class="ph codeph">ROWS</samp>  section. The nonzeros of the
reference row are used as weights within an SOS. All weights within
one SOS must be unique values. A <samp class="ph codeph">REFROW</samp> 
section is optional; if no reference row is specified, the weighting
values 1, . . . , n is given to the n members
of an SOS in the order in which they are read. In other words, without
specific reference row information, it is assumed that the user has
ordered the SOS variables in ascending order with respect to some
relevant criterion (for example, in importance, capacity, objective
weighting, or cost).</p>
