<title>Changes in behavior of LP concurrent optimizer</title>
</head>
<body role="main" id="descriptiveTopic1272530118718">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">Changes in behavior of LP concurrent optimizer</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes changes in default behavior with respect to concurrent
optimization of linear programming models.</p>
<p class="p">The concurrent optimizer launches distinct optimizers on multiple
threads. By default, CPLEX  now offers <strong class="ph b">concurrent</strong>, <strong class="ph b">deterministic</strong> optimization
of linear programming models (LPs) when <strong class="ph b">more than one thread</strong> is
available. This improved default behavior means better performance
in most cases when you simply load and solve a linear programming
model from scratch.</p>
<p class="p">This change in default behavior may affect your existing application
under these conditions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Running concurrent optimizers simultaneously on multiple threads
may consume more memory. If that increase use of memory prevents CPLEX
from solving your model effectively, you may need to revert to your
previous choice of optimizer, rather than adopt this new default behavior
of the concurrent optimizer.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If the <a class="xref" href="../../../Parameters/topics/MemoryEmphasis.html" title="Directs CPLEX that it should conserve memory where possible.">memory reduction switch</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_MEMORYEMPHASIS</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">MemoryEmphasis</samp>)
is turned on, then you have instructed CPLEX to conserve memory. In
that case, CPLEX does <strong class="ph b">not</strong> offer concurrent, deterministic optimization
of linear programming models by default even if there is more than
one thread available. In other words, if there is more than one thread
available, and if you want CPLEX to invoke concurrent, deterministic
optimization, then <strong class="ph b">either</strong> you must be sure that the memory
reduction switch is turned off (its default setting) <strong class="ph b">or</strong> you
must explicitly set the <a class="xref" href="../../../Parameters/topics/LPMETHOD.html" title="Controls which algorithm is used to solve continuous models or to solve the root relaxation of a MIP.">algorithm for continuous problems</a> (also known
as the LP method parameter, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_LPMETHOD</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">RootAlg</samp>)
to the value 6, <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_ALG_CONCURRENT</samp>.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If your existing application offers more than one thread to
CPLEX, you may want to consider whether the concurrent optimizer solves
your model more efficiently now than your previous choice of optimizer.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If your existing application currently invokes an optimizer
(such as the Callable Library routine <span class="keyword apiname">CPXlpopt</span>)
at <strong class="ph b">default </strong>settings, you may observe a change in behavior because
of this change in default behavior of concurrent optimization. In
such a case, you may need to evaluate whether to adopt this new behavior
or to revert to the previous choice of optimizer. See the topic <a class="xref" href="releasenotescplex122_8.html#descriptiveTopic1272530118718__section1272619306122">Special considerations and remedies</a> for
more guidance about this point.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If your existing application currently invokes optimization
at <strong class="ph b">nondefault</strong> settings, you may need to reconsider those nondefault
settings in light of the new behavior. See the topic <a class="xref" href="releasenotescplex122_8.html#descriptiveTopic1272530118718__section1272619306122">Special considerations and remedies</a> for
more guidance about this point.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If your application invokes concurrent optimization in a <strong class="ph b">callback</strong>,
it must do so in the <strong class="ph b">first thread</strong> (not in other threads).</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">During concurrent optimization, only the dual simplex optimizer
invokes user-written <strong class="ph b">callbacks</strong>. Other optimizers running concurrently
do <strong class="ph b">not</strong> invoke user-written callbacks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="descriptiveTopic1272530118718__RrDTI6LN"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Previous behavior</h2><p class="p">In previous
versions of CPLEX, when you invoked optimization for a linear programming
model (LP), the dual simplex optimizer solved the model by default.
This behavior has changed: if more than one thread is available to
solve your model, CPLEX launches competing optimizers concurrently
on the available threads.</p>
<p class="p">Moreover, the default behavior of
concurrent optimization in previous releases was opportunistic, that
is, not deterministic. (For more detail about the differences between
opportunistic and deterministic optimization, see the topics 
<a class="xref" href="../../../UsrMan/topics/parallel_optim/multi_threaded_parallel/07_determinism.html" title="Defines determinism and describes its effect in parallel optimization.">Determinism of results</a> and 
<a class="xref" href="../../../UsrMan/topics/parallel_optim/multi_threaded_parallel/11_concurrent.html" title="Describes the concurrent optimizer.">Concurrent optimizer in parallel</a> in 
the <em class="ph i">CPLEX User’s Manual</em>.) This behavior has changed: concurrent
optimization of LPs is now <strong class="ph b">deterministic</strong> by default, and opportunistic
mode is still available through the <a class="xref" href="../../../Parameters/topics/ParallelMode.html" title="Sets the parallel optimization mode. Possible modes are automatic, deterministic, and opportunistic.">parallel mode switch</a> documented
in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX Parameters Reference Manual</em>.</p>
<p class="p">Furthermore,
in previous versions of CPLEX, when you invoked concurrent optimization,
it was not able to take advantage of starting information, such as
a start vector, warm start, or partial solution. This limitation no
longer exists: if you supply <strong class="ph b">starting information</strong>, concurrent
optimization makes use of it now.</p>

<div class="section" id="descriptiveTopic1272530118718__section1272619306122"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Special considerations and
remedies</h2><p class="p">With the new default behavior, you may observe
changes in the log that reports CPLEX activity during concurrent optimization.
Specifically, you may observe a point in the log when CPLEX reports
a solution of the LP model by an optimizer, but no other report of
activity appears in the log for a considerable time afterward. During
this apparently inactive period, concurrent optimization deterministically
manages potential race conditions among competing optimizers in order
to resolve deterministically from which of those optimizers to accept
the final solution.</p>
<p class="p">If
this apparent wait during the race between concurrent optimizers poses
a problem for your application, there are two alternative remedies
available to you:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Use opportunistic mode, rather than the default deterministic
mode. To do so, change the setting of the  <a class="xref" href="../../../Parameters/topics/ParallelMode.html" title="Sets the parallel optimization mode. Possible modes are automatic, deterministic, and opportunistic.">parallel mode switch</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_PARALLELMODE</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">ParallelMode</samp>)
documented in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX Parameters Reference Manual</em>.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Set the optimizer that consistently solves your model first
as the starting algorithm in your application. </p>
 <p class="p">To
do so, set the parameter appropriate for your type of model:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><a class="xref" href="../../../Parameters/topics/LPMETHOD.html" title="Controls which algorithm is used to solve continuous models or to solve the root relaxation of a MIP.">algorithm for continuous problems</a> (<samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAM_LPMETHOD</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">RootAlg</samp>)
