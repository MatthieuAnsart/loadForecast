<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Announces new routines and methods to implement your own
distributed algorithms with the CPLEX remote object.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX V12.5 offers a <strong class="ph b">remote object</strong> to facilitate your own
implementation of <strong class="ph b">distributed parallel algorithms</strong>.  Though
CPLEX itself does not implement a distributed parallel algorithm as
such, the CPLEX remote object greatly simplifies your development
of your own  application implementing a distributed parallel algorithm.
For an introduction to this new feature, see the topic  
<a class="xref" href="../../../UsrMan/topics/parallel_optim/remote_obj/00_remote_obj_synopsis.html" title="Introduces the remote object available in CPLEX for distributed parallel optimization.">Remote object for distributed parallel optimization</a> 
in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX User's Manual</em>. That introduction
includes sample code contrasting a local  application of CPLEX with
an application making use of this remote object in a distributed 
application. </p>
<p class="p">CPLEX V12.5 also includes new <strong class="ph b">examples</strong>, demonstrating  this
new feature in applications. The new example <span class="ph filepath">parmipopt.c</span> 
shows how to run distributed MIP optimizations concurrently in parallel.
  The new example <span class="ph filepath">parbenders.c</span> takes a Benders
decomposition of  a model to run in parallel in a distributed environment.
 There are also additional generic and  platform-specific <strong class="ph b">make
files</strong> along with sample <strong class="ph b">projects</strong> in CPLEX 12.5 to assist
you in executing  those examples, as well as in developing and deploying
your own distributed applications using the CPLEX remote  object on
all plaforms supported by CPLEX V12.5.</p>
<p class="p"> For further detail about the routines  supporting the CPLEX remote
object, see especially the documentation of the new routine  in the
Callable Library (C API) <span class="keyword apiname">CPXXopenCPLEXremote</span>. </p>
