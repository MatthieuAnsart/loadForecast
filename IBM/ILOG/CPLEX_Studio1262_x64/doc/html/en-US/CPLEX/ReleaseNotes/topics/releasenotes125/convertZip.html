<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX V12.5 supports compressed file formats; limitations apply.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX V12.5 supports compressed files on all platforms, including Microsoft Windows, UNIX, and GNU/Linux. 
In particular, CPLEX can read and write compressed files with these file extensions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">.bz2</li>
<li class="li">.gz</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Limitations apply</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">CPLEX V12.5 does not support files compressed by WinZip. </li>
<li class="li">CPLEX V12.5 does not read files that were compressed by the 
UNIX or GNU/Linux compression tool named "compress" which produces 
a file with the extension .Z. (Earlier versions of CPLEX that successfully 
read files with the .Z extension relied on a tool that CPLEX no longer uses.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Remedy</strong></p>
<p class="p">If you have a file which you want CPLEX to read, but the file 
was compressed by "compress" or by WinZip, then you must first uncompress the file 
by means of the appropriate tool, and then pass the uncompressed file to CPLEX.  
If your situation requires that you pass a compressed file 
to CPLEX, then you can uncompress that file and compress it with a compression tool 
known to CPLEX, such as one of these compression tools:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">bzip2 to produce a compressed file with the file extension .bz2</li>
<li class="li">gzip to produce a compressed file with the file extension .gz</li>
</ul>
