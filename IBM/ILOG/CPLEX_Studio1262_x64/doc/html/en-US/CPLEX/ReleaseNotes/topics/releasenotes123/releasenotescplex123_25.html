<title>New features for users of MATLAB</title>
</head>
<body role="main" id="descriptiveTopic1300045335172">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">New features for users of MATLAB</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes new features available to users of the
CPLEX connector for The MathWorks MATLAB.</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle" id="descriptiveTopic1300045335172__paragroup1300046277345">64-bit
MATLAB connector</p>
<p class="p">In CPLEX V12.3, the CPLEX connector for The MathWorks
MATLAB is compatible with installations of MATLAB that support 64-bits,
such as Mac OS. (Previous versions of the CPLEX connector for MATLAB
were already compatible with 64-bit Microsoft Windows and 64-bit GNU/Linux
operating systems.)</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">Priority orders in MATLAB</p>
<p class="p">In CPLEX V12.3, the CPLEX connector for MATLAB supports
priority orders for branching. For general information about priority
orders for branching, see the topic <a class="xref" href="../../../UsrMan/topics/discr_optim/mip/para/50_priority_orders.html" title="Describes priority order to control MIP optimization.">Issuing priority orders</a> in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX
User’s Manual</em>. For details specific to priority orders in the
CPLEX connector for MATLAB, see the online help available in a MATLAB
session.</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">Tolerances in MATLAB</p>
<p class="p">In the CPLEX connector for MATLAB, the Toolbox parameter <samp class="ph codeph">TolFun</samp> has been refined to distinguish the value
used in LP models from the value used in MIP models. In other words,
you can now set different tolerances for your LP and MIP models. In
an LP model, the Toolbox parameter <samp class="ph codeph">TolFun</samp> corresponds
to <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.Param.simplex.tolerances.optimality</samp> in
the class API. In a MIP model, the Toolbox parameter <samp class="ph codeph">TolFun</samp> corresponds
to the method <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.Param.mip.tolerances.absmipgap</samp> in
the class API.</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">Named files for exporting
models</p>
<p class="p">In the CPLEX connector for MATLAB, the user can now specify
the name of a file to export a model. In the Toolbox, the user specifies
a file name with a new option of <samp class="ph codeph">ExportModel</samp>.
(In the class API, the user specifies a file name with the existing
method <samp class="ph codeph">writeModel</samp>.)</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">Sign of lambda (Lagrange
multipliers)</p>
<p class="p">In CPLEX V12.3, the CPLEX connector for MATLAB now conforms
to conventions in MATLAB with respect to the sign (positive or negative)
of <strong class="ph b">lambda</strong> in the methods <samp class="ph codeph">lambda.ineqlin</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">lambda.eqlin</samp>. The lambda structure is documented
in the reference manual of the CPLEX connector for MATLAB.</p>
<p class="p">In this context, the fields of a lambda structure contain
the <strong class="ph b">Lagrange multipliers</strong> for the solution returned
by an optimization. In previous versions, CPLEX conventions about
characteristics of a solution were not consistent with MATLAB conventions;
in other words, the sign of lambda appeared reversed to MATLAB users.
This inconsistency in conventions between the two products has been
reconciled in favor of the MATLAB convention with respect to lambda
and Lagrange multipliers in these two methods <samp class="ph codeph">lambda.ineqlin</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">lambda.eqlin</samp>.</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">New parameters in MATLAB</p>
<p class="p">Parameters formerly available only in other APIs of CPLEX
are now available as well to users of the CPLEX connector for MATLAB
in CPLEX V12.3. For further information about these parameters, see
the online documentation about CPLEX available in a MATLAB session.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">cplex.Param.output.mpslong</samp> specifies
the degree of precision for CPLEX to write numbers to a file in MPS
format.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">cplex.Param.output.writelevel</samp> specifies
the level of detail for CPLEX to write a solution to a file in SOL
format or a MIP start to a file in MST format.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">cplex.Param.output.intsolfileprefix</samp> turns
on or off CPLEX output to write the current MIP incumbent integer
solution to a file and sets a prefix for the name of that file.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">cplex.Param.output.clonelog</samp> (the
new parameter to clone the logs of nodes during parallel optimization)
is also available in CPLEX V12.3 connector for MATLAB. Its default
value 1 (one) clones the logs of nodes in parallel optimization. Use
the value 0 (zero) to turn off this feature.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">Problem structure as input
to class constructor</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">Cplex</samp> class constructor
can now take a problem structure as input. Each of the toolbox functions
defines “problem structure” in its reference entry. In other words,
this new constructor makes it easier to switch between Toolbox functions
and the class API.</p>
<p class="p paragrouptitle" id="descriptiveTopic1300045335172__paragroup1302196601191">Quality
report: kappa for QP in MATLAB</p>
<p class="p">In CPLEX V12.3, the connector for MATLAB produces a solution
quality report to show the kappa condition number of models solved
by the simplex algorithm, even for models with a quadratic term in
the objective function (QP problem type). For instructions about producing
a solution quality report in the Cplex Class API, see the online documentation
about CPLEX available in a MATLAB session.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  There was an error in earlier versions of these release
notes which implied that the solution quality report is available
through the CPLEX for MATLAB Toolbox functions. In fact, the solution
quality report is available from only the Cplex Class API. For more
information, see <a class="xref" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21573656" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Technote: Accessing CPLEX solution quality
metrics in MATLAB</a> (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21573656).</div>
<p class="p paragrouptitle" id="descriptiveTopic1300045335172__paragroup1302197333161">Interrupting
CPLEX in MATLAB</p>
<p class="p">Earlier versions of the CPLEX connector for MATLAB recognized <samp class="ph msgph">control-C</samp> to interrupt the solution process. Now,
you can interrupt certain other processes as well by means of <samp class="ph msgph">control-C</samp>, in the class API:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Tuning CPLEX parameters with the method <samp class="ph codeph">tuneparam</samp></p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Using the method <samp class="ph codeph">feasopt</samp></p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Refining conflicts with the method <samp class="ph codeph">refineconflict</samp></p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Populating the solution pool with the method <samp class="ph codeph">populate</samp></p>
