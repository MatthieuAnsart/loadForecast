<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Documents new features of CPLEX V12.6.0</p>
<p class="p">These notes highlight new features of interest to users of CPLEX V12.6.0.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New names of parameters</h2> 
 <p class="p">New names of all existing parameters are available in CPLEX V12.6.0. These new names are 
 organized hierarchically, for greater ease of use. The reference manual of CPLEX Parameters 
 documents both the new name and the existing, previous name of each parameter in each  
 application programming interface (API) and in each component, such as the Interactive Optimizer 
 or MATLAB connector. 
 See the announcement 
 <a class="xref" href="newParameters.html" title="Documents new parameters of CPLEX V12.6.0.">New parameters for all users</a>
 in these release notes for more detail.
 </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Solving nonconvex QP and MIQP</h2>
<p class="p">CPLEX now finds global solutions of <strong class="ph b">nonconvex</strong> quadratic programs (that is, 
nonconvex QPs) and <strong class="ph b">nonconvex</strong> mixed integer quadratic programs 
(that is, nonconvex MIQPs). In other words,  CPLEX solves the minimization of 
problems with a quadratic objective function and linear constraints 
in which the objective function is not necessarily convex; or equivalently, 
CPLEX solves the maximization of a QP or MIQP in which the objective function 
is not necessarily concave.</p>

<p class="p">Such a problem of linear constraints with possibly one or more quadratic terms in the 
objective function is also sometimes known as an <strong class="ph b">indefinite</strong> QP. Likewise, 
a problem of linear constraints where some variables are also constrained to be 
integer and with possibly one or more quadratic terms in the 
objective function is also sometimes known as an <strong class="ph b">indefinite</strong> MIQP.</p>

<p class="p">For an introduction to this new feature, see the announcement 
<a class="xref" href="newNonconvexMIQP.html" title="Documents a new feature of CPLEX V12.6.0: global solution of nonconvex QP and MIQP">Global solution of nonconvex MIQP</a>
in these release notes.</p>

<p class="p">For more detail about this new feature, see also the new topic

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Solving a distributed MIP in parallel</h2>
<p class="p">CPLEX now offers more support for the solution in parallel of mixed integer programs (MIPs) 
in a distributed computing environment. This new feature, known as distributed 
parallel MIP optimization, 
is a mode of running CPLEX that harnesses the power of multiple computers or 
of multiple nodes inside a single computer to achieve better performance on some MIP problems. 
For an introduction to this new feature, see the announcement  
<a class="xref" href="newDistribMIP.html" title="Announces distributed parallel MIP optimization">Distributed parallel MIP optimization</a> 
in these release notes, and for a fuller description with examples, see the topic
