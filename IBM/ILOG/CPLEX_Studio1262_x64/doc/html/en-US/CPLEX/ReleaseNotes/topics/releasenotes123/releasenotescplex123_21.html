<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Announces improved utilities for reading and writing
SAV files.</p>
<p class="p">The SAV file format has been improved in this release.
The new format is more robust and more modular, making it possible
to add items to an existing SAV file. Also the routines for reading
and writing SAV files now issue a warning if they encounter data that
cannot be processed. The routines for reading and writing the new
SAV format manage non-ASCII data more gracefully. The new SAV format
is compatible with the new 64-bit counter for nonzero coefficients
in a large model; in other words, the SAV file format can now accommodate
models with a much greater number of nonzero coefficients.  Moreover,
the improved SAV file format makes it possible for you to take advantage
of globalization in CPLEX V12.3 to select the encoding (that is, the
code page) to use in reading and writing files. In particular, a model
written with a 64-bit version of CPLEX can be read by a 32-bit version
as long as the data in the file does not require 64-bit integers.</p>
<p class="p">Continue using the usual read and write functions to take
advantage of this improved format; that is, no change in your applications
is required. In CPLEX V12.3, the routines for reading and writing
SAV files can also read SAV files created by previous versions. However,
the read and write routines of previous versions of CPLEX cannot take
advantage of these improvements in the SAV file format; in particular,
previous versions of CPLEX cannot read new SAV files written by CPLEX
V12.3.</p>
