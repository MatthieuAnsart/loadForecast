<h1 class="title topictitle1">New features in the Callable Library: 64-bit integer counters</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Describes the new feature supporting much larger models
and recommends migration paths for those users who plan to apply the
new feature.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX V12.3 offers <strong class="ph b">64-bit integer</strong> counters in the Callable
Library (C API). This new feature allows models in which the number
of nonzero coefficients exceeds the number previously available. In
previous versions of CPLEX, for example, the practical number of nonzero
coefficients in a model was no more than 2,100,000,000, regardless
of whether the operating system supported 32 or 64 bits. With the
new 64-bit API, models with as many as 9e<sup class="ph sup">18</sup> nonzero coefficients
 (approximately 9,223,372,036,800,000,000) are limited only by the
memory available on your computer. CPLEX V12.3 also offers other,
correspondingly large counters for the number of iterations, number
of nodes processed, indices of nodes, number of aggregations, and
so forth.</p>
<p class="p">For clarity in these release notes, “32-bit API” refers to the
existing Callable Library (C API) of previous versions of CPLEX. Likewise,
“64-bit API” refers to the implementation of this new feature. The
familiar 32-bit API is still available, as well as its familiar include
file <span class="ph filepath">cplex.h</span>. Each of the routines in the 32-bit
API has been duplicated by a new routine, prefixed by <samp class="ph codeph">CPXX</samp> (for <em class="ph i">CPLEX
extended</em>) and declared in a new header file, <span class="ph filepath">cplexx.h</span>.
For example, the existing 32-bit routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXsolution</samp> declared
in <span class="ph filepath">cplex.h</span> now has a new corresponding 64-bit
routine <samp class="ph codeph">CPXXsolution</samp> declared in <span class="ph filepath">cplexx.h</span> .
Another <strong class="ph b">new include file</strong>, <span class="ph filepath">cpxconst.h</span>,
declares the common constants that routines declared in either <span class="ph filepath">cplex.h</span> or <span class="ph filepath">cplexx.h</span> require;
they implicitly include <samp class="ph codeph">cpxconst.h</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">Your application of the Callable Library (C API) can mix and match
routines from both the 32-bit and 64-bit APIs of CPLEX V12.3, if necessary
to adapt an existing application. However, recommended practice for
new applications is to use the new 64-bit API.</p>
<div class="section" id="Release_notes.uss_relnotescplex.1031909__section1299763975083"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">No changes for 32-bit applications</h2><p class="p">Your
existing 32-bit applications continue to run as expected on existing
models with no modification. CPLEX V12.3 automatically takes advantage
of the new 64-bit feature where possible. However, if you would like
to adapt your application or your models to include a very large number
of nonzero coefficients, then consider the new 64-bit API.</p>
<p class="p">For
example, if your application does not pass in or query more than two
billion (that is, 2<sup class="ph sup">31</sup>) nonzeros at a time in such routines
as <samp class="ph codeph">CPXaddrows</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">CPXaddcols</samp>, then
you can continue using the 32-bit API unchanged.</p>
<p class="p">Likewise, if
your application includes CPLEX parameters for which specified values
are no more than <samp class="ph codeph">INT_MAX</samp>, then you can continue using
the 32-bit API unchanged.</p>
<p class="p">However, if your application assigns
a very large value to a CPLEX integer parameter (for example, a value
greater than or equal to <samp class="ph codeph">INT_MAX</samp>), then you need
to use the new 64-bit API. For a list of which new routines to use
with respect to these large-valued parameters, see the topic <a class="xref" href="releasenotescplex123_23.html#Release_notes.uss_relnotescplex.1031909__section1300618636884">Possible changes in CPLEX extended parameters</a> in

64-bit applications</h2><p class="p">To take advantage of the 64-bit API
of CPLEX V12.3 in your applications of the Callable Library (C API),
you simply include the new header file <span class="ph filepath">cplexx.h</span>,
which implicitly includes <span class="ph filepath">cpxconst.h</span>; then use
new routines introduced in these header files; that is, routines prefixed
by <samp class="ph codeph">CPXX</samp>. </p>
<p class="p"> In
the new 64-bit API, integers are replaced by new symbols.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPX_APIMODEL</samp> specifies to the CPLEX Callable
Library (C API)  whether to anticipate a small (fewer than two billion
nonzero coefficients) or a large model. CPLEX V12.3 then chooses the <strong class="ph b">types</strong> of
counters for dimensions, number of rows, number of columns, number
of nonzero coefficients, buffer sizes, lengths of names, and other
counters appropriately. Normally, by default, CPLEX V12.3 discerns
these types from your operating system and automatically chooses appropriately.
However, if you need to <strong class="ph b">control bit-length of integers</strong> explicitly,
use values of this symbol in your application to specify a large or
small model.</p>
 <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span>  <p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPX_APIMODEL</samp> affects
only the API, not the library. Internally, the library always uses
32-bit nonzero counters on 32-bit ports and 64-bit nonzero counters
on 64-bit ports. <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_APIMODEL</samp> allows you to specify
which types to use when your application interacts with the library.
If the data types requested by <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_APIMODEL</samp> are different
from the types used internally, then the library will perform appropriate
transformations.</p>
 </div>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPXCNT</samp> specifies the integer type that <span class="ph filepath">cplexx.h</span> uses
to pass potentially large <strong class="ph b">counters</strong>, such as number of nodes,
number of iterations, and so forth, to the CPLEX Callable Library
(C API) or to read such data from the library. The type of <samp class="ph codeph">CPXCNT</samp> is

counts, and so forth, to the CPLEX Callable Library (C API) or to
read such data from the library. The type of <samp class="ph codeph">CPXDIM</samp> is
32-bit integer.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPXNNZ</samp> specifies the integer type that <span class="ph filepath">cplexx.h</span> uses
to pass the number of <strong class="ph b">nonzero coefficients</strong> to the CPLEX Callable
Library (C API) or to read such data from it. The actual type of <samp class="ph codeph">CPXNNZ</samp> depends
on the current setting of <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_APIMODEL</samp>.</p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPXSIZE</samp> specifies a <strong class="ph b">signed</strong> integer
to represent the size in bytes (not characters) of <strong class="ph b">names</strong> associated
with the model, its variables, and its constraints. Technically, <samp class="ph codeph">CPXSIZE</samp> is
a signed integer type of the same width as <samp class="ph codeph">size_t</samp>.
It is defined in <samp class="ph codeph">cpxconst.h</samp>, which in turn is included
by <samp class="ph codeph">cplex.h</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">cplexx.h</samp> appropriately.</p>

CPLEX parameters of type <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAMTYPE_LONG</samp>; that
is, those parameters accepting <samp class="ph codeph">CPXLONG</samp> as a value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If you want to adapt your existing applications to take advantage
of 64-bit counters, for example, to solve models with more than two
billion nonzero coefficients, and you want to do so in a way that
is portable in future applications, use those symbols (<samp class="ph codeph">typedef</samp>s
and <samp class="ph codeph">macro</samp>s) in your application to support such portability.</p>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span>  <p class="p">Code that you write using these new symbols takes best

<div class="section" id="Release_notes.uss_relnotescplex.1031909__section1300618636884"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Possible changes in CPLEX
extended parameters</h2><p class="p">Certain parameters that accept an integer
value have been extended by a change in their type. This extension
supports much greater number of nodes, number of nonzero coefficients,
number of iterations, and so forth. CPLEX V12.3 offers new features
to manage these new, larger integer parameters; these new features
seek to minimize the inconvenience of this change in type for users
of previous versions of CPLEX. The following notes explain the impact
of this extension of integer parameters to much greater values.</p>
<p class="p">Specifically,
the new 64-bit API extends the possible value of certain CPLEX parameters
in CPLEX V12.3 by changing the type of the parameter in a transparent
way. These parameters (which formerly accepted values of type <samp class="ph codeph">int</samp>)
are now themselves of type <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAMTYPE_LONG</samp>. This
new symbol enables code that you write using this symbol to take advantage
fully of the address space on your platform, whether your platform
is 32-bit or 64-bit. The table <a class="xref" href="releasenotescplex123_4.html#Release_notes.uss_relnotescplex.1030684__table1300702477401">Table 2</a> lists
those parameters extended by this change on all platforms. The table <a class="xref" href="releasenotescplex123_4.html#Release_notes.uss_relnotescplex.1030684__table1300706463231">Table 3</a> lists
the parameters that depend on your declaration as 32-bit or 64-bit
of the symbol <samp class="ph codeph">CPXNNZ</samp> (the number of nonzeros); the
compile-time value of this symbol depends on your port, that is, your
combination of compiler and operating system.</p>
<p class="p">Parameters of
this new 64-bit type can still be controlled through the 32-bit API
as long as the values do not exceed <samp class="ph codeph">INT_MAX</samp>. If you
set a <samp class="ph codeph">LONG</samp> parameter by means of the 32-bit API to
a value greater than or equal to <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_BIGINT</samp> as a
representation of infinity, then CPLEX V12.3 will quietly transform
this symbol into <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_BIGLONG</samp>, the value that denotes
infinity (approximately 9e+18). </p>
<p class="p">To use control parameters that
accept values greater than <samp class="ph codeph">INT_MAX</samp> in your application
of the 32-bit API, use these new routines from the 64-bit API instead:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">CPXXsetlongparam</span></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">CPXXgetlongparam</span></p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">CPXXinfolongparam</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p paragrouptitle">C API: changes for large integer
parameters</p>
<p class="p">In the Callable Library, you can still invoke these
existing 32-bit routines on all parameter types.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"> <samp class="ph codeph">CPXsetintparam</samp></p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPXgetintparam</samp></p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPXinfointparam</samp> </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">This invocation of the existing 32-bit routines (<samp class="ph codeph">CPXsetintparam</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPXgetintparam</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CPXinfointparam</samp>)
will not fail, but silent <strong class="ph b">truncation</strong> can occur if the parameter
is in fact of type <samp class="ph codeph">LONG</samp> and the result cannot be
represented by a 32-bit number. </p>
<p class="p">New 32-bit routines treat parameters
of type <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAMTYPE_LONG</samp> correctly:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPXsetlongparam</samp></p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPXgetlongparam</samp></p>
 </li>
<li class="li"><p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CPXinfolongparam</samp></p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">You can, if necessary, also invoke these new routines for
long parameters on parameters of type <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAMTYPE_INT</samp>.
These new long parameter routines work correctly there. This practice
of invoking the new routines for long parameters on parameters of
type  <samp class="ph codeph">CPX_PARAMTYPE_INT</samp> is <strong class="ph b">not</strong> recommended,
but the practice is allowed for convenience with respect to parameters
in the table <a class="xref" href="releasenotescplex123_4.html#Release_notes.uss_relnotescplex.1030684__table1300706463231">Table 3</a>.
For parameters in that table, this practice (allowed but not recommended)
treats each parameter in a way that does not depend on the actual
port (combination of compiler and operating system) in use.</p>
