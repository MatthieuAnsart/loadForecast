<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Suggests ways to evaluate impact of new encoding parameters
on existing applications.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX V12.3 offers new parameters to control encoding
of file names and other data passed between your application and the
APIs of CPLEX. For more about these new parameters, see the topic <a class="xref" href="releasenotescplex123_2.html#Release_notes.uss_relnotescplex.1009061__section1299681055028">Globalization: new parameters for encoding</a> in these release notes. </p>
<p class="p"> In the context of these new parameters, CPLEX V12.3
respects these conventions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">CPLEX V12.3 passes file names to your
operating system intact, with no change, up to the terminating 0-byte. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">CPLEX V12.3 also passes encodings (that
is, the name of a code page, such as the string <samp class="ph codeph">UTF-8</samp>)
in tact, up to the terminating 0-byte.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">As a result of modifications in CPLEX V12.3 with respect
to encoding of strings passed to the APIs and retrieved from the APIs,
comparison of a string, such as a variable name, in a user’s
application, with the apparently same string retrieved from the API
can give surprising results. In particular, the conventional system
function <samp class="ph codeph">strcmp</samp> can return unexpected results
due to differences in encoding (that is, code pages) and its lack
of awareness of normalization.</p>
<p class="p">To avoid misleading comparisons by <samp class="ph codeph">strcmp</samp> especially
with respect to <strong class="ph b">names of variables</strong>,
the following alternative strategies exist. These alternative strategies
are listed in order, starting from the best to the most problematic. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">Use the <strong class="ph b">index</strong> of
the variable, rather than its name (a string) for comparison. The
index of a variable is unique and does not risk misleading results
from a comparison of strings, regardless of encoding. </p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Use a <strong class="ph b">normalization</strong>-aware
string comparison instead.  International Components for Unicode (ICU)
offers functions for string comparison; those ICU functions are aware
of normalization; consequently, their comparison of strings, such
as variable names, will return reliable results. (The conventional <samp class="ph codeph">strcmp</samp> is
not normalization-aware.)</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Normalize strings by means of Normalized
Form C (<strong class="ph b">NFC</strong>) in your application
before you compare them.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">As soon as you introduce a variable
to CPLEX (for example, when you add the variable to your model), normalize
its name immediately in your application by retrieving its name from
CPLEX; store that normalized name for comparisons with <samp class="ph codeph">strcmp</samp>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> <p class="p">Two strings that look identical on a display may not
compare as equal since the stored representation can be different.
For example, data tagged with a UTF-8 or UTF-16 CCSID can contain
combining characters. Combining characters allow a resulting character
to be composed of more than one character. After the first character
of the compound character, one of many different non-spacing characters
(such as umlauts and accents) can follow in the data string. If the
resulting character is one that is already defined in the character
set, <strong class="ph b">normalization</strong> of the string
results in multiple combining-characters being replaced by the value
of the defined character. </p>
