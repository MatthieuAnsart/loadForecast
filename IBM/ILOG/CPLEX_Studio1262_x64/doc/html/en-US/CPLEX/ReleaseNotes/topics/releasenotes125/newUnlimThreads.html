<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Introduces new routines and methods to access number of cores; removes limit on number of threads.</p>
<p class="p">The number of threads for CPLEX to use can now be set to any positive integer number, even if this number
exceeds the number of cores on the machine. The default behavior of CPLEX with
respect to the number of threads and cores remains unchanged. That is, by default,
CPLEX continues to use as many threads as there are cores.</p>
<p class="p">Earlier versions of CPLEX licensed for a given number of cores are still limited to
the licensed number.</p>
<div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution">Setting the number of threads to a number greater than the number of cores 
on the machine typically results in degradation of the performance of CPLEX optimizers. </div>
<p class="p">Nevertheless, in some situations it is useful to exploit a larger number of threads 
than the number of available cores. For example, some operating systems report a smaller number of cores 
than the number actually available in the computing hardware. In those situations, where you 
know surely that the number of cores is actually larger than the number reported by the operating system, 
then setting the number of threads available to CPLEX can be advantageous.</p>
<p class="p">Furthermore, when you must accurately reproduce results on machines with differing numbers of cores, 
you can improve reproducibility of results by setting the number of threads available to CPLEX 
accordingly.</p>
<p class="p">To assist you in calculating the number of threads that CPLEX uses by default (that is, 
the number of cores) on your platform, CPLEX offers these new routines and methods:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">In the Callable Library (C API), see the routine <span class="keyword apiname">CPXXgetnumcores</span>.</li>
<li class="li">In the C++ API, see the method <span class="keyword apiname">IloCplex::getNumCores</span>.</li>
<li class="li">In the Java API, see the method <span class="keyword apiname">IloCplex.getNumCores</span>.</li>
<li class="li">In the .NET API, see the property <span class="keyword apiname">Cplex.NumCores</span>.</li>
<li class="li">In the Python API, see the method <span class="keyword apiname">cplex.get_num_cores</span>.</li>
