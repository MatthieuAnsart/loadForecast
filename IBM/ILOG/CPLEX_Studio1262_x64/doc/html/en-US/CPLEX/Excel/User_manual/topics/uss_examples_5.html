<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Provides an optimization model of a production planning
problem with fixed costs that minimizes the sum of fixed and variable
costs so that the company exactly meets demand.</p>
<p class="p">This is an implementation in Excel spreadsheet form of
a production planning problem with fixed costs. </p>
<p class="p">A company must produce a product on a set of machines.
Each machine has limited capacity. Producing a product on a machine
has both a fixed cost and a cost per unit of production.  </p>
<p class="p">The problem is to minimize the sum of fixed and variable
costs so that the company exactly meets demand.</p>
<p class="p">The problem is located in the <span class="ph filepath">&lt;cplexinstalldir&gt;\examples\src\excel</span> directory
and is defined in the spreadsheet as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Data Section — The knowns in
this problem are the Fixed costs, Variable costs, and Capacity. Also
known is the Demand.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Variables Section — The unknowns
indicate whether each machine is used, and if so, how much it is used.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Constraints Section — The constraints
in this problem are machine capacity constraints. A machine has capacity <span class="ph uicontrol">0</span> if
unused and capacity as specified in the table if used.						 						</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Objective Function Section —
The objective is the sum of the fixed costs for machines which are
selected and the variable costs for the amount of production on the
selected machines, which should be minimized.</p>
</li>
</ul>

of using Excel names or named ranges to illustrate the use of this
syntax.</p>
