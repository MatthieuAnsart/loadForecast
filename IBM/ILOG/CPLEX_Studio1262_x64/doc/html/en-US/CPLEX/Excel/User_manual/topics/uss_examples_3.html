<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Provides an optimization model of the classic diet problem,
a linear program to choose the amount of foods in a diet to meet nutritional
requirements at the lowest cost.</p>
<p class="p">This is an implementation in Excel spreadsheet form of
the classic diet problem — a linear program to choose the amount
of foods in a diet to meet nutritional requirements at the lowest
cost.</p>
<p class="p">The problem is located in the <span class="ph filepath">&lt;cplexinstalldir&gt;\examples\src\excel</span> directory
and is defined in the spreadsheet as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Data Section — The knowns in
this problem are the amount of nutrition provided by a given quantity
of a given food, the cost per unit of food, and the upper and lower
bounds on the foods to be purchased for the diet.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Variables Section — The unknowns
are the quantities of each food to buy.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Constraints Section — The constraints
in this problem are that the food bought to consume must satisfy basic
nutritional requirements, and that amount of each food purchased must
not exceed what is available.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Objective Function Section —
The objective is to minimize the cost of the food to be bought. (The
objective function is the sum of the cost of each food times the amount
of each food.)</p>
