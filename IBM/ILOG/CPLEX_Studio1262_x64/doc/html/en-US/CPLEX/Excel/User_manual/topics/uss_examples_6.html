<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Provides an optimization model of  a classic food manufacturing
problem in which production is planned over six months to maximize
profit when refining and blending several types of oils into a final
product which is sold.</p>
<p class="p">This is an implementation in Excel spreadsheet form of
a classic food manufacturing problem — two types of vegetable
oils and three types of non-vegetable oils are available to refine
and blend into a final product which is sold. The production is planned
over six months to maximize profit.  </p>
<p class="p">This example was taken from the example in the book <em class="ph i">Model Building in Mathematical Programming</em>,
4th ed. by H. P. Williams. This is the second version of the problem
where the additional conditions which make the problem a mixed integer
program are imposed.</p>
<p class="p">The problem is located in the <span class="ph filepath">&lt;cplexinstalldir&gt;\examples\src\excel</span> directory
and is defined in the spreadsheet as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Data Section — The knowns in
this problem are data concerning the oils: refining capacity, product
price, the maximum oils to be used, and the upper and lower limits
of the hardness of the oils. Also known is a forecast of the price
of the raw oils over the next six months.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Variables Section — The unknowns
are the amounts of each oil to be stored and bought over the six months
of the planning horizon.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Constraints Section — The constraints
in this problem include:</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The final product must have its hardness
between minimum and maximum standards. The hardness of the final product
is linear in the hardness of the input oils.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If a raw oil is used in the final product,
at least the specified amount must be used.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Linking constraints — the amount
of product stored in the previous month plus the amount bought in
this month must equal the amount used and stored in this month.				
				 				 				</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Each type of oil is refined on separate
equipment which has a limited capacity.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The hardness of the final product must
meet upper and lower limits.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">There is a constraint to link the <samp class="ph codeph">InUse</samp> variable
to the <samp class="ph codeph">Use</samp> variable	</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">There is a constraint to limit the number
of oils in the blend.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If <samp class="ph codeph">Veg Oil</samp> is
used, also use <samp class="ph codeph">Oil 3</samp>.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Constraint on minimal oil usage if oil
is used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Objective Function Section —
The objective is to maximize profit: revenue from selling product
minus storage expense and the cost of raw oils.</p>
</li>
</ul>
