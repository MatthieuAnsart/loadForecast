<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Provides an optimization model of a facility location
problem that decides which facilities to open in order to supply clients
at minimum cost.</p>
<p class="p">This is an implementation in Excel spreadsheet form of
a facility location problem. The problem is to decide which facilities
to open in order to supply clients at minimum cost. Opening a facility
has a fixed cost and the cost to supply a client from a facility depends
on the facility.</p>
<p class="p">The problem is located in the <span class="ph filepath">&lt;cplexinstalldir&gt;\examples\src\excel</span> directory
and is defined in the spreadsheet as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Data Section — The knowns in
this problem are the names, capacity, and fixed costs of each facility.
Also known are the supply costs for each client per facility.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Variables Section — The unknowns
are binary variables for each facility-client pair (which is <span class="ph uicontrol">1</span> if
that assignment is used), and a binary variable for each facility
(which is <strong class="ph b">1</strong> if the facility is
to be used).</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Constraints Section — The constraints
in this problem include:</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Number of clients supplied from a facility
must not exceed the capacity of the facilities. The capacity is <span class="ph uicontrol">0</span> unless
the facility is open.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The number of facilities that supply
a client must be <span class="ph uicontrol">1</span>.				</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Objective Function Section —
The objective is to minimize the cost of supplying all clients. There
is a cost for opening each facility and a cost for using a facility
to supply a client.</p>
</li>
</ul>
