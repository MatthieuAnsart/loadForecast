<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Provides an optimization model of a classic blending
problem that involves mixing some metals to form an alloy.</p>
<p class="p">This is an implementation in Excel spreadsheet form of
a classic blending problem. The metal blending example involves mixing
some metals to form an alloy. </p>
<p class="p">The metal may come from several sources: in pure form,
from raw materials, as scraps from previous mixes, or as ingots. The
alloy must contain certain amounts of the various metals, as expressed
by a production constraint specifying lower and upper bounds for the
quantity of each metal in the alloy. Each source has a cost and the
problem consists of blending from the sources while minimizing the
cost and satisfying the production constraint. Similar problems arise
in other domains, for example, the oil, paint, and food-processing
industries.</p>
<p class="p">The problem is located in the <span class="ph filepath">&lt;cplexinstalldir&gt;\examples\src\excel</span> directory
and is defined in the spreadsheet as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Data Section — The knowns in
this problem are the component elements of the alloy. Each source
material is composed of these elements in varying  proportions. The
proportion of the elements in the alloy can vary between minimum and
maximum proportions. The cost of each component and the amount of
alloy to produce are also given.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Variables Section — The unknowns
are the amounts of each source materials to use and the amount of
each element in the alloy.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Constraints Section — The constraints
in this problem include:</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The sum of the elements in the alloy
must equal the amount of the alloy.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The alloy composition must be in a specific
range for each element. These constraints use the variables containing
the amount of each element in the alloy and the minimum and maximum
proportion from the data table.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Objective Function Section —
The objective is to minimize the cost of producing the alloy. The
objective function is the sum of the cost of each source times the
amount of that source used in the alloy.</p>

</ul>
