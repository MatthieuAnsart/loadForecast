REM Example .bat file that starts up a TCP/IP worker on the local
REM for use with distributed parallel MIP. The first argument to
REM this script is the port number on which to listen, the remaining
REM arguments are the distributed MIP application and its arguments.

REM Start the TCP/IP worker on the localhost. The port on which
REM the worker listens is the first argument to this script. The
REM task id of the worker is stored in file tcpippid. We use that
REM to check whether the worker did start up and to kill it later.

REM Wait 5 seconds so that we can be sure the worker did start up
REM before we continue. Use TASKLIST to make sure the worker did
REM actually start up.
